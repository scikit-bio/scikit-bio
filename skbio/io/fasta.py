FASTA/QUAL format (:mod:`skbio.io.fasta`)
=========================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.io.fasta

The FASTA file format (``fasta``) stores biological (i.e., nucleotide or
protein) sequences in a simple plain text format that is both human-readable
and easy to parse. The file format was first introduced and used in the FASTA
software package [1]_. Additional descriptions of the file format can be found
in [2]_ and [3]_.

An example of a FASTA-formatted file containing two DNA sequences::

    >seq1 db-accession-149855
    CGATGTCGATCGATCGATCGATCAG
    >seq2 db-accession-34989
    CATCGATCGATCGATGCATGCATGCATG

The QUAL file format is an additional format related to FASTA. A FASTA file is
sometimes accompanied by a QUAL file, particuarly when the fasta file contains
sequences generated on a high-throughput sequencing instrument. QUAL files
store a Phred quality score (nonnegative integer) for each base in a sequence
stored in FASTA format (see [4]_ for more details). scikit-bio supports reading
and writing FASTA (and optionally QUAL) file formats.

   in addition to FASTA sequence data.

Format Specification
--------------------
The following sections define the FASTA and QUAL file formats in detail.

FASTA Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A FASTA file contains one or more biological sequences. The sequences are
stored sequentially, with a *record* for each sequence (also referred to as a
*FASTA record*). Each *record* consists of a single-line *header* (sometimes
referred to as a *defline*, *label*, *description*, or *comment*) followed by
the sequence data, optionally split over multiple lines. Blank or
whitespace-only lines are not allowed anywhere in the FASTA file.

.. note:: scikit-bio does not currently support legacy FASTA format (i.e.,
   headers/comments denoted with a semicolon). The format supported by
   scikit-bio (described below in detail) most closely resembles the
   description given in NCBI's BLAST documentation [3]_. See [2]_ for more
   details on legacy FASTA format. If you would like legacy FASTA format
   support added to scikit-bio, please consider submitting a feature request on
   the
   `scikit-bio issue tracker <https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/issues>`_
   (pull requests are also welcome!).

Sequence Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each sequence header consists of a single line beginning with a greater-than
(``>``) symbol. Immediately following this is a sequence identifier (ID) and
description separated by one or more whitespace characters. Both sequence ID
and description are optional and are represented as the empty string (``''``)
in scikit-bio's objects if they are not present in the header.

A sequence ID consists of a single *word*: all characters after the greater-
than symbol and before the first whitespace character (if any) are taken as the
sequence ID. Unique sequence IDs are not strictly enforced by the FASTA format
itself. A single standardized ID format is similarly not enforced by FASTA
format, though it is often common to use a unique library accession number for
a sequence ID (e.g., NCBI's FASTA defline format [5]_).

.. note:: scikit-bio will enforce sequence ID uniqueness depending on the type
   of object that the FASTA file is read into. For example, reading a FASTA
   file as a generator of ``BiologicalSequence`` objects will not enforce
   unique IDs since it simply yields each sequence it finds in the FASTA file.
   However, if the FASTA file is read into a ``SequenceCollection`` object, ID
   uniqueness will be enforced because that is a requirement of a
   ``SequenceCollection``.

If a description is present, it is taken as the remaining characters that
follow the sequence ID and initial whitespace(s). The description is considered
additional information about the sequence (e.g., comments about the source of
the sequence or the molecule that it encodes).

For example, consider the following header::

    >seq1 db-accession-149855

``seq1`` is the sequence ID and ``db-accession-149855`` is the sequence
description.

.. note:: scikit-bio's readers will remove all leading and trailing whitespace
   from the description. If a header line begins with whitespace following the
   ``>``, the ID is assumed to be missing and the remainder of the line is
   taken as the description.

Sequence Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Biological sequence data follows the header, and can be split over multiple
lines. The sequence data (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) are stored using
the standard IUPAC lexicon (single-letter codes).

.. note:: scikit-bio supports both upper and lower case characters. Both ``-``
   and ``.`` are supported as gap characters. See :mod:`skbio.sequence` for
   more details on how scikit-bio interprets sequence data in its in-memory
   objects.

   scikit-bio will remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line of
   sequence data before joining the sequence chunks into a single sequence.
   Whitespace characters are **not** removed from the middle of the sequence
   chunks. Likewise, other invalid IUPAC characters are **not** removed from
   the sequence data as it is read. Thus, it is possible to create an invalid
   in-memory sequence object (see warning below).

.. warning:: In an effort to maintain reasonable performance while reading
   FASTA files (which can be quite large), validation of sequence data is
   **not** performed during reading. It is the responsibility of the user to
   validate their in-memory representation of the data if desired (e.g., by
   calling ``is_valid`` on the returned object). Thus, it is possible to read
   invalid characters into objects (e.g. whitespace occurring in the middle of
   a sequence, or invalid IUPAC DNA characters in a DNA sequence).

QUAL Format
^^^^^^^^^^^
A QUAL file contains quality scores for one or more biological sequences stored
in a corresponding FASTA file. QUAL format is very similar to FASTA format: it
stores records sequentially, with each record beginning with a header line
containing a sequence ID and description. The same rules apply to QUAL headers
as FASTA headers (see the above sections for details). scikit-bio processes
FASTA and QUAL headers in exactly the same way.

Instead of storing biological sequence data in each record, a QUAL file stores
a Phred quality score for each base in the corresponding sequence. Quality
scores are represented as nonnegative integers separated by whitespace
(typically a single space or newline), and can span multiple lines.

.. note:: When reading FASTA and QUAL files, scikit-bio requires records to be
   in the same order in both files (i.e., each FASTA and QUAL record must have
   the same ID and description after being parsed). In addition to having the
   same order, the number of FASTA records must match the number of QUAL
   records (i.e., missing or additonal records are not allowed). scikit-bio
   also requires that the number of quality scores match the number of bases in
   the corresponding sequence.

   When writing FASTA and QUAL files, scikit-bio will maintain the same
   ordering of records in both files (i.e., using the same ID and description
   in both records) to support future reading.

Format Parameters
-----------------
The following parameters are available to change how FASTA/QUAL files are read
or written in scikit-bio.

QUAL File Parameter (Readers and Writers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``qual`` parameter is available to all FASTA format readers and writers. It
can be any file-like type supported by scikit-bio's I/O registry (e.g., file
handle, file path, etc.). If ``qual`` is provided when reading, quality scores
will be included in each in-memory ``BiologicalSequence`` object, in addition
to sequence data stored in the FASTA file. When writing, quality scores will be
written in QUAL format in addition to the sequence data being written in FASTA
format.

Reader-specific Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The available reader parameters differ depending on which reader is used.

Generator, SequenceCollection, and Alignment Reader Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``constructor`` parameter can be used with the ``BiologicalSequence``
generator, ``SequenceCollection``, and ``Alignment`` FASTA readers.
``constructor`` specifies the in-memory type of each sequence that is parsed,
and defaults to ``BiologicalSequence``. ``constructor`` should be a subclass of
``BiologicalSequence``. For example, if you know that the FASTA file you're
reading contains protein sequences, you would pass
``constructor=ProteinSequence`` to the reader call.

.. note:: The FASTA sniffer will not attempt to guess the ``constructor``
   parameter, so it will always default to ``BiologicalSequence`` if another
   type is not provided to the reader.

BiologicalSequence Reader Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``seq_num`` parameter can be used with the ``BiologicalSequence``,
``NucleotideSequence``, ``DNASequence``, ``RNASequence``, and
``ProteinSequence`` FASTA readers. ``seq_num`` specifies which sequence to read
from the FASTA file (and optional QUAL file), and defaults to 1 (i.e., such
that the first sequence is read). For example, to read the 50th sequence from a
FASTA file, you would pass ``seq_num=50`` to the reader call.

Writer-specific Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following parameters are available to all FASTA format writers:

- ``id_whitespace_replacement``: string to replace **each** whitespace
  character in a sequence ID. This parameter is useful for cases where an
  in-memory sequence ID contains whitespace, which would result in an on-disk
  representation that would not be read back into memory as the same ID (since
  IDs in FASTA format cannot contain whitespace). Defaults to ``_``. If
  ``None``, no whitespace replacement is performed and IDs are written as they
  are stored in memory (this has the potential to create an invalid
  FASTA-formatted file; see note below). This parameter also applies to a QUAL
  file if one is provided.

- ``description_newline_replacement``: string to replace **each** newline
  character in a sequence description. Since a FASTA header must be a single
  line, newlines are not allowed in sequence descriptions and must be replaced
  in order to write a valid FASTA file. Defaults to a single space. If
  ``None``, no newline replacement is performed and descriptions are written as
  they are stored in memory (this has the potential to create an invalid
  FASTA-formatted file; see note below). This parameter also applies to a QUAL
  file if one is provided.

- ``max_width``: integer specifying the maximum line width (i.e., number of
  characters) for sequence data and/or quality scores. If a sequence or its
  quality scores are longer than ``max_width``, it will be split across
  multiple lines, each with a maximum width of ``max_width``. Note that there
  are some caveats when splitting quality scores. A single quality score will
  *never* be split across multiple lines, otherwise it would become two
  different quality scores when read again. Thus, splitting only occurs
  *between* quality scores. This makes it possible to have a single long
  quality score written on its own line that exceeds ``max_width``. For
  example, the quality score ``12345`` would not be split across multiple lines
  even if ``max_width=3``. Thus, a 5-character line would be written. Default
  behavior is to not split sequence data or quality scores across multiple
  lines.

.. note:: The FASTA format writers will have noticeably better runtime
   performance if ``id_whitespace_replacement`` and/or
   ``description_newline_replacement`` are set to ``None`` so that whitespace
   replacement is not performed during writing. However, this can potentially
   create invalid FASTA files, especially if there are newline characters in
   the IDs or descriptions. For IDs with whitespace, this can also affect how
   the IDs are read into memory in a subsequent read operation. For example, if
   an in-memory sequence ID is ``'seq 1'`` and
   ``id_whitespace_replacement=None``, reading the FASTA file back into memory
   would result in an ID of ``'seq'``, and ``'1'`` would be part of the
   sequence description.

Examples
--------

Reading and Writing FASTA Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Suppose we have the following FASTA file with five equal-length sequences
(example modified from [6]_)::

    >seq1 Turkey
    AAGCTNGGGCATTTCAGGGTGAGCCCGGGCAATACAGGGTAT
    >seq2 Salmo gair
    AAGCCTTGGCAGTGCAGGGTGAGCCGTGG
    CCGGGCACGGTAT
    >seq3 H. Sapiens
    ACCGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTACAGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTAA
    >seq4 Chimp
    AAACCCTTGCCG
    TTACGCTTAAAC
    CGAGGCCGGGAC
    ACTCAT
    >seq5 Gorilla
    AAACCCTTGCCGGTACGCTTAAACCATTGCCGGTACGCTTAA

.. note:: Original copyright notice for the above example file:

   *(c) Copyright 1986-2008 by The University of Washington. Written by Joseph
   Felsenstein. Permission is granted to copy this document provided that no
   fee is charged for it and that this copyright notice is not removed.*

Note that the sequences are not required to be of equal length in order for the
file to be a valid FASTA file (this depends on the object that you're reading
the file into). Also note that some of the sequences occur on a single line,
while others are split across multiple lines.

Let's define this file in-memory as a ``StringIO``, though this could be a real
file path, file handle, or anything that's supported by scikit-bio's I/O
registry in practice:

>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> fs = (
...     ">seq1 Turkey\\n"
...     "AAGCTNGGGCATTTCAGGGTGAGCCCGGGCAATACAGGGTAT\\n"
...     ">seq2 Salmo gair\\n"
...     "AAGCCTTGGCAGTGCAGGGTGAGCCGTGG\\n"
...     "CCGGGCACGGTAT\\n"
...     ">seq3 H. Sapiens\\n"
...     "ACCGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTACAGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTAA\\n"
...     ">seq4 Chimp\\n"
...     "AAACCCTTGCCG\\n"
...     "TTACGCTTAAAC\\n"
...     "CGAGGCCGGGAC\\n"
...     "ACTCAT\\n"
...     ">seq5 Gorilla\\n"
...     "AAACCCTTGCCGGTACGCTTAAACCATTGCCGGTACGCTTAA\\n")
>>> fh = StringIO(fs)

Let's read the FASTA file into a ``SequenceCollection``:

>>> from skbio import SequenceCollection
>>> sc = SequenceCollection.read(fh)
>>> sc.sequence_lengths()
[42, 42, 42, 42, 42]
>>> sc.ids()
['seq1', 'seq2', 'seq3', 'seq4', 'seq5']

We see that all 5 sequences have 42 characters, and that each of the sequence
IDs were successfully read into memory.

Since these sequences are of equal length (presumably because they've been
aligned), let's load the FASTA file into an ``Alignment`` object, which is a
more appropriate data structure:

>>> from skbio import Alignment
>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> aln = Alignment.read(fh)
>>> aln.sequence_length()
42

Note that we were able to read the FASTA file into two different data
structures (``SequenceCollection`` and ``Alignment``) using the exact same
``read`` method call (and underlying reading/parsing logic). Also note that we
didn't specify a file format in the ``read`` call. The FASTA sniffer detected
the correct file format for us!

Let's inspect the type of sequences stored in the ``Alignment``:

>>> aln[0]
<BiologicalSequence: AAGCTNGGGC... (length: 42)>

By default, sequences are loaded as ``BiologicalSequence`` objects. We can
change the type of sequence via the ``constructor`` parameter:

>>> from skbio import DNASequence
>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> aln = Alignment.read(fh, constructor=DNASequence)
>>> aln[0]
<DNASequence: AAGCTNGGGC... (length: 42)>

We now have an ``Alignment`` of ``DNASequence`` objects instead of
``BiologicalSequence`` objects. Validation of sequence character data is not
performed during reading (see warning above for details). To verify that each
of the sequences are valid DNA sequences:

>>> aln.is_valid()
True

To write the alignment in FASTA format:

>>> new_fh = StringIO()
>>> aln.write(new_fh)
>>> print(new_fh.getvalue())
>seq1 Turkey
AAGCTNGGGCATTTCAGGGTGAGCCCGGGCAATACAGGGTAT
>seq2 Salmo gair
AAGCCTTGGCAGTGCAGGGTGAGCCGTGGCCGGGCACGGTAT
>seq3 H. Sapiens
ACCGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTACAGGTTGGCCGTTCAGGGTAA
>seq4 Chimp
AAACCCTTGCCGTTACGCTTAAACCGAGGCCGGGACACTCAT
>seq5 Gorilla
AAACCCTTGCCGGTACGCTTAAACCATTGCCGGTACGCTTAA
<BLANKLINE>
>>> new_fh.close()

Both ``SequenceCollection`` and ``Alignment`` load all of the sequences from
the FASTA file into memory at once. If the FASTA file is large (which is often
the case), this may be infeasible if you don't have enough memory. To work
around this issue, you can stream the sequences using scikit-bio's
generator-based FASTA reader and writer. The generator-based reader yields
``BiologicalSequence`` objects (or subclasses if ``constructor`` is supplied)
one at a time, instead of loading all sequences into memory. For example, let's
use the generator-based reader to process a single sequence at a time in a
``for`` loop:

>>> import skbio.io
>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> for seq in skbio.io.read(fh, format='fasta'):
...     seq
<BiologicalSequence: AAGCTNGGGC... (length: 42)>
<BiologicalSequence: AAGCCTTGGC... (length: 42)>
<BiologicalSequence: ACCGGTTGGC... (length: 42)>
<BiologicalSequence: AAACCCTTGC... (length: 42)>
<BiologicalSequence: AAACCCTTGC... (length: 42)>

A single sequence can also be read into a ``BiologicalSequence`` (or subclass):

>>> from skbio import BiologicalSequence
>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> BiologicalSequence.read(fh)
<BiologicalSequence: AAGCTNGGGC... (length: 42)>

By default, the first sequence in the FASTA file is read. This can be
controlled with ``seq_num``. For example, to read the fifth sequence:

>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> BiologicalSequence.read(fh, seq_num=5)
<BiologicalSequence: AAACCCTTGC... (length: 42)>

We can use the same API to read the fifth sequence into a ``DNASequence``:

>>> fh = StringIO(fs) # reload the StringIO to read from the beginning again
>>> dna_seq = DNASequence.read(fh, seq_num=5)
>>> dna_seq
<DNASequence: AAACCCTTGC... (length: 42)>

Individual sequence objects can also be written in FASTA format:

>>> new_fh = StringIO()
>>> dna_seq.write(new_fh)
>>> print(new_fh.getvalue())
>seq5 Gorilla
AAACCCTTGCCGGTACGCTTAAACCATTGCCGGTACGCTTAA
<BLANKLINE>
>>> new_fh.close()

Reading and Writing FASTA/QUAL Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to reading and writing standalone FASTA files, scikit-bio also
supports reading and writing FASTA and QUAL files together. Suppose we have the
following FASTA file::

    >seq1 db-accession-149855
    CGATGTC
    >seq2 db-accession-34989
    CATCG

Also suppose we have the following QUAL file::

    >seq1 db-accession-149855
    40 39 39 4
    50 1 100
    >seq2 db-accession-34989
    3 3 10 42 80

>>> fasta_fs = (
...     ">seq1 db-accession-149855\\n"
...     "CGATGTC\\n"
...     ">seq2 db-accession-34989\\n"
...     "CATCG\\n")
>>> fasta_fh = StringIO(fasta_fs)
>>> qual_fs = (
...     ">seq1 db-accession-149855\\n"
...     "40 39 39 4\\n"
...     "50 1 100\\n"
...     ">seq2 db-accession-34989\\n"
...     "3 3 10 42 80\\n")
>>> qual_fh = StringIO(qual_fs)

To read in a single ``BiologicalSequence`` at a time, we can use the
generator-based reader as we did above, providing both FASTA and QUAL files:

>>> for seq in skbio.io.read(fasta_fh, qual=qual_fh, format='fasta'):
...     seq
...     seq.quality
<BiologicalSequence: CGATGTC (length: 7)>
array([ 40,  39,  39,   4,  50,   1, 100])
<BiologicalSequence: CATCG (length: 5)>
array([ 3,  3, 10, 42, 80])

Note that the sequence objects have quality scores since we provided a QUAL
file. The other FASTA readers operate in a similar manner.

Now let's load the sequences and their quality scores into a
``SequenceCollection``:

>>> fasta_fh = StringIO(fasta_fs) # reload to read from the beginning again
>>> qual_fh = StringIO(qual_fs) # reload to read from the beginning again
>>> sc = SequenceCollection.read(fasta_fh, qual=qual_fh)
>>> sc
<SequenceCollection: n=2; mean +/- std length=6.00 +/- 1.00>

To write the sequence data and quality scores in the ``SequenceCollection`` to
FASTA and QUAL files, respectively, we run:

>>> new_fasta_fh = StringIO()
>>> new_qual_fh = StringIO()
>>> sc.write(new_fasta_fh, qual=new_qual_fh)
>>> print(new_fasta_fh.getvalue())
>seq1 db-accession-149855
CGATGTC
>seq2 db-accession-34989
CATCG
<BLANKLINE>
>>> print(new_qual_fh.getvalue())
>seq1 db-accession-149855
40 39 39 4 50 1 100
>seq2 db-accession-34989
3 3 10 42 80
<BLANKLINE>
>>> new_fasta_fh.close()
>>> new_qual_fh.close()
