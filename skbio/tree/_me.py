    Notes
    -----
    Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) [1]_ is a distance-based algorithm for phylogenetic
    reconstruction. It utilizes the minimum evolution (ME) principle [2]_ for selecting
    a tree topology with the lowest sum of branch lengths, as calculated using an
    ordinary least squares (OLS) framework [3]_.

    GME is *O*\(*n*:sup:`2`) in time and *O*\(*n*) in space, making it a more scalable
    method that multiple alternatives (e.g., :func:`nj` and :func:`bme`). Therefore it
    is suitable for reconstructing very large phylogenetic trees.

    GME generates an unrooted tree with variable tip heights and potentially some
    negative branch lengths. The first taxon in the distance matrix is always placed as
    a child of the root node. See the notes of :func:`nj` for how to deal with unrooted
    trees and negative branch lengths.

    A GME-generated tree may be further improved by executing the FastNNI algorithm
    implemented in :func:`nni` (with ``balanced=False``).

    A similar but less scalable algorithm using the balanced instead of OLS framework
    is provided in :func:`bme`.

    The same methods underlying :func:`gme`, :func:`bme` and :func:`nni` NI were also
    provided by the software package FastME [4]_.

    .. note::
        These scikit-bio functions were implemented following the original paper [1]_.
        It is not guaranteed that they will precisely mirror FastME's output. Although
        in practices they typically generate identical or equally optimal phylogenetic
        trees as FastME does.

    Notes
    -----
    Balanced Minimum Evolution (BME) [1]_ is a refinement of the distance-based minimum
    evolution problem where the average distances between subtrees are independent of
    the sizes of the subtrees. This is referred to as a balanced (or simply BME)
    framework [2]_, as in contrast to the OLS framework used by GME (:func:`gme`).

    The BME algorithm implemented here uses a similar greedy algorithm as implemented
    in :func:`gme`, but less scalable due to the need to update subtree distances as
    the tree topology changes. The algorithm is sub-*O*\(*n*:sup:`3`) in time and
    *O*\(*n*:sup:`2`) in space.

    Refer to :func:`gme` for the format of the output tree and subsequent treatments.

    A BME-generated tree may be further improved by executing the BNNI algorithm
    implemented in :func:`nni` (with ``balanced=True``).

    The same method was provided by FastME [3]_. See :func:`gme` for notes on this.

    .. note::
        Experimental feature: Add ``parallel=True`` will enable parallelization,
        which might increase the performance of the algorithm. This feature may not
        be stable and may be modified without notice in the future.

    TreeNode
        Rearranged phylogenetic tree.

    Notes
    -----
    Nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) is a method for tree rearrangement aiming at
    optimizing a given tree topology according to certain criteria. It iteratively
    swaps neighboring branches that could result in better trees, until no such swaps
    remain in the optimized tree.

    This function performs NNI for the minimum evolution (ME) problem on phylogenetic
    trees. The implementation is based on [1]_. Two versions of the method are
    provided: the FastNNI algorithm (``balanced=False``) based on an ordinary least
    squares (OLS) framework (see also :func:`gme`) and the BNNI algorithm
    (``balanced=True``) based on a balanced framework (see also :func:`bme`). The
    former is more scalable than the latter.

    The input tree may be rooted or unrooted, and it must be strictly bifurcating. One
    can apply :meth:`~TreeNode.is_bifurcating` or :meth:`~TreeNode.bifurcate` to check
    or make a bifurcating tree. The set of taxa in the tree (accessible via
    :meth:`~TreeNode.subset`) must match those in the distance matrix.

    The output tree is unrooted, with the first taxon in the distance matrix placed as
    a child of the root node. Branch lengths are assigned according to the framework of
    choice. See also :func:`nj` regarding rooting an unrooted tree and dealing with
    potential negative branch lengths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : ndarray of float of shape (m, m)

    Returns
    -------
    tree : ndarray of int of shape (2m - 3, 4)
        Reconstructed tree topology by GME.
    lens : ndarray of float of shape (2m - 3,)
        Estimated branch lengths by OLS.

    Notes
    -----
    The GME algorithm involves growing an unrooted tree by iteratively inserting taxa.
    In the beginning it initializes a triplet tree with the first three taxa:

          0
          |
          x
         / \
        1   2

    Taxon 0 is placed at the root position, with its unique descendant x serving as
    connector for taxa 1 and 2 as its left and right children. Next, taxon 3 will
    be inserted into a branch that suffices the minimum evolution criterion. Let's say
    the branch connecting x and 2. The tree becomes:

          0
          |
          x
         / \
        1   y
           / \
          2   3

    So on so forth until all taxa are included in the tree.

    Finally, branch lengths are estimated using an ordinary least squares (OLS)
    framework.

    ---

    This implementation uses an array-based tree structure to improve efficiency. See
    :func:`_check_tree` for details of this structure. Basically, the root node (taxon
    0) is omitted, making the tree strictly binary. Instead, the unique descendant (x)
    is now treated as the root and marked with taxon 0:

          0
         / \
        1   y
           / \
          2   3

    The root is always the first row in the tree array. Other nodes are appended to the
    tree array in the same order as they are added to the tree.

    ---

    For an input distance matrix with m taxa, the output tree will have 2m - 3 nodes.
    This memory space is pre-allocated to improve efficiency. The algorithm doesn't
    remake arrays during iteration, but repeatedly uses the already allocated space.
    During an interation involving x nodes, the first x positions of each array are
    occupied, while the remaining positions are disregarded. There is no need to reset
    array values after each iteration.

    Since they are created de novo, all arrays are C-continuous. This permits further
    optimization in the Cython code.

    r"""Perform fast nearest neighbor interchange (FastNNI) on a tree.

    To improve the tree under the minimum evolution (ME) criterion using an OLS
    framework on a distance matrix between taxa.

    This algorithm was implemented following Section 2.2 and Appendix 4 of Desper and
    Gascuel (2002). Basically, it creates a full average distance matrix between all
    pairs of subtrees, evaluates all possible swaps, then it iteratively perform
    swaps that lead to the maximum reduction of overall branch lengths. During this
    process, it needs to update the evaluation of the four corner branches after one
    branch is swapped.

    ---

    The swaps that can reduce overall branch length are stored in a heap. The paper
    suggests using a maxheap, but the following code uses Python's heapq which is a
    minheap. Therefore the length changes are negated (in contrast to `_bnni`). Each
    item in the heap is a tuple consisting of:

        0. Length change (negative; smaller is better)
        1. Corresponding node index
        2. Corresponding side (0: left, 1: right) child to be swapped with sibling

    For example, (-0.15, 7, 1) means that swapping the right child and the sibling of
    node 7 will reduce the overall branch length by 0.15.

    Meanwhile, the length change of each node is stored in `lens`. For root and tips,
    this value is 0. For internal nodes, this value is negative or 0. Only negative
    values are stored in the heap. 0 means this node is not useful.

    Additionally, the "side" information is stored in column 7 of the tree array.

    When a swap is updated, the new length change (if negative) is pushed into the
    heap, but the old length change won't be deleted from the heap (which would be
    inefficient as O(n)). Instead, a "lazy deletion" mechanism is adopted: When the
    negative-most swap is popped out of the heap, it is checked against the stored
    length change (in `lens`) and side (in `tree[:, 7]`). If they don't match, then
    it means that it is outdated and should be skipped. Otherwise, it is considered
    relevant and the swap will be performed.

    TODO: heapq is a Python module and may not be efficient. Tests showed that the
    code isn't significantly faster than a naive `np.argmax` on then entire `lens`.
    Consider optimization.

    To improve the tree under the balanced minimum evolution (BME) criterion given a

    Basically, BNNI is similar to FastNNI (see `_fastnni`), but it needs to update
    more than the four corner branches after each swap, as balanced average distances
    are dependent on the topology of the tree.

    a large proportion of swaps need to be re-evaluated during every iteration, one
    would expect that a heap structure as suggested for the FastNNI algorithm may not

def _check_tree(tree, preodr, postodr):
    r"""Check the integrity of an array-based tree structure.

    The greedy algorithms implemented in this module use a special array-based tree
    structure to improve efficiency.

    In this 2-D array, rows represent nodes in the order of addition to the tree,
    with the root placed at row 0. There are eight columns:

        0. Left child index, or 0 if a tip.
        1. Right child index, or taxon index if a tip.
        2. Parent index, or 0 if root.
        3. Sibling index, or 0 if root.
        4. Size, i.e., number of taxa descending from the node, or 1 if a tip.
        5. Depth, i.e., number of branches constituting the path to root.
        6. Preorder index.
        7. Postorder index.

    Meanwhile, node indices in preorder and postorder are stored in two separate 1-D
    arrays to facilitate traversals.

    Note: Columns 2-7 and the two separate arrays can be derived from columns 0 and 1.
    They are explicitly stored because of their frequent usage during the calculation.
    Also, they are updated iteratively as the tree grows, which is more efficient than
    de novo calculation on an existing tree.

    ---

    For example, a tree with four taxa is like (see :func:`_gme`):

          0
         / \
        1   y
           / \
          2   3

    This tree can be represented by the following 2-D array:

        [[1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4],
         [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],
         [3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3],
         [0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1],
         [0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2]]

    The separate pre- and postorder arrays are:

        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        [1, 3, 4, 2, 0]

    This function fills in pre-allocated tree arrays. It doesn't return any value.

    Nodes in the resulting tree array are ordered by preorder traversal. This may not
    agree with the order they were added to the original tree, if that ever happened.
    Therefore, one shouldn't directly compare the original and generated tree arrays.
    However, the topologies represented by the two tree arrays should be identical.

    The function doesn't fill branch lengths, which aren't required by the downstream
    algorithms. Adding this functionality should be straightforward.

    Parameters ``pos`` and ``depth`` are typically set by :func:`_root_from_treenode`.
    One doesn't need to specify them if working with this function alone. ``depth``
    also impacts the position in ``postodr``. See ``_root_from_treenode`` for
