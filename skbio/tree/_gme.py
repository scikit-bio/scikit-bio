def gme(dm, allow_edge_estimation=True):
    r"""Perform greedy minimum evolution (GME) for phylogenetic reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : skbio.DistanceMatrix
        Input distance matrix containing distances between taxa.
    allow_edge_estimation : bool, optional
        Whether to perform an OLS-based estimation of edge values (``True``, default)
        or return a tree without edge values assigned (``False``).

    Returns
    -------
    TreeNode
        Reconstructed phylogenetic Tree with estimated edge
        values (if ``allow_edge_estimation`` is ``True``).

    Notes
    -----
    Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) is a distance-based algorithm for phylogenetic
    reconstruction utilizing the minimum evolution principle for selecting a tree
    topology with the lowest sum of branch lengths according to a given method
    of estimating branch lengths. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a natural
    framework for edge estimation as it is statistically consistent with
    minimum evolution and is used for GME.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a new distance matrix object describing the distances between five
    taxa: human, monkey, pig, rat, and chicken.

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.tree import gme

    >>> dm = DistanceMatrix([[0, 0.02,  0.18,  0.34,  0.55],
    ...                      [0.02,  0, 0.19, 0.35,  0.55],
    ...                      [0.18, 0.19,  0,  0.34,  0.54],
    ...                      [0.34, 0.35,  0.34,  0,  0.62],
    ...                      [0.55,  0.55,  0.54,  0.62,  0]],
    ...                      ['human','monkey','pig','rat','chicken'])

    Perform Greedy Minimum Evoltuion (GME) and construct the minimum evolution tree
    representing the relationship between those taxa. This is returned as a TreeNode
    object.

    >>> tree = gme(dm)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())

    Notice that, unlike neighbor joining, the tree is rooted at a taxa/leaf node.
    This will allow it to have nearest neighbor interchange performed on it without
    needing to re-root the tree.
