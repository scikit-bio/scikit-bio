def nj(dm, disallow_negative_branch_length=True, result_constructor=None):
    """ Apply neighbor joining for phylogenetic reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : skbio.DistanceMatrix
        Input distance matrix containing distances between OTUs.
    disallow_negative_branch_length : bool, optional
        Neighbor joining can result in negative branch lengths, which don't
        make sense in an evolutionary context. If `True`, negative branch
        lengths will be returned as zero, a common strategy for handling this
        issue that was proposed by the original developers of the algorithm.
    result_constructor : function, optional
        Function to apply to construct the result object. This must take a
        newick-formatted string as input. The result of applying this function
        to a newick-formatted string will be returned from this function. This
        defaults to ``lambda x: TreeNode.read(StringIO(x), format='newick')``.

    Returns
    -------
    TreeNode
        By default, the result object is a `TreeNode`, though this can be
        overridden by passing `result_constructor`.

    See Also
    --------
    TreeNode.root_at_midpoint

    Notes
    -----
    Neighbor joining was initially described in Saitou and Nei (1987) [1]_. The
    example presented here is derived from the Wikipedia page on neighbor
    joining [2]_. The Phylip manual also describes the method [3]_ and Phylip
    itself provides an implementation which is useful for comparison.

    Neighbor joining, by definition, creates unrooted trees. One strategy for
    rooting the resulting trees is midpoint rooting, which is accessible as
    ``TreeNode.root_at_midpoint``.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a new distance matrix object describing the distances between five
    OTUs: a, b, c, d, and e.

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.tree import nj

    >>> data = [[0,  5,  9,  9,  8],
    ...         [5,  0, 10, 10,  9],
    ...         [9, 10,  0,  8,  7],
    ...         [9, 10,  8,  0,  3],
    ...         [8,  9,  7,  3,  0]]
    >>> ids = list('abcde')
    >>> dm = DistanceMatrix(data, ids)

    Contstruct the neighbor joining tree representing the relationship between
    those OTUs. This is returned as a TreeNode object.

    >>> tree = nj(dm)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())
              /-d
             |
             |          /-c
             |---------|
    ---------|         |          /-b
             |          \--------|
             |                    \-a
             |
              \-e

    Again, construct the neighbor joining tree, but instead return the newick
    string representing the tree, rather than the TreeNode object. (Note that
    in this example the string output is truncated when printed to facilitate
    rendering.)

    >>> newick_str = nj(dm, result_constructor=str)
    >>> print(newick_str[:55], "...")
    (d:2.000000, (c:4.000000, (b:3.000000, a:2.000000):3.00 ...
