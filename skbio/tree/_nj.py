    r"""Perform neighbor joining (NJ) for phylogenetic reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : skbio.DistanceMatrix
        Input distance matrix containing pairwise distances among taxa.
    clip_to_zero : bool, optional
        If True (default), convert negative branch lengths into zeros.
    result_constructor : function, optional
        Function to apply to construct the result object. This must take a
        newick-formatted string as input. Deprecated and to be removed in a
        future release.

        .. deprecated:: 0.6.3

    inplace : bool, optional
        If True, the input distance matrix will be manipulated in-place to reduce
        memory consumption, at the cost of losing the original data. Default is False.

        .. versionadded:: 0.6.3

    Returns
    -------
    TreeNode
        Reconstructed phylogenetic tree.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.6.3
            The NJ algorithm has been optimized. The output may be slightly different
            from the previous version in root placement, node ordering, and the numeric
            precision of branch lengths. However, the overall tree topology and branch
            lengths should remain the same.

    Notes
    -----
    Neighbor joining (NJ) was initially described by Saitou and Nei (1987) [1]_. It is
    a simple and efficient agglomerative clustering method that builds a phylogenetic
    tree based on a distance matrix.

    This function implements the canonical NJ method. The algorithm has been optimized
    to improve efficiency, but no heuristic was involved to further accelerate it at
    the cost of accuracy. Therefore, one is guaranteed to obtain an optimal tree. The
    algorithm is *O*\(*n*:sup:`3`) in time and *O*\(*n*:sup:`2`) in space.

    NJ creates an **unrooted** tree with varying tip heights. This contrasts UPGMA
    (:func:`upgma`), which always produces ultrametric trees. One may subsequently use
    choice of strategies such as midpoint rooting (:meth:`~TreeNode.root_at_midpoint`)
    or outgroup rooting (:meth:`~TreeNode.root_by_outgroup`) to convert the result into
    a rooted tree.

    NJ is most accurate when distances are **additive** -- the distance between two
    taxa in the matrix equals to the sum of branch lengths connecting them in the tree.
    When this assumption is violated, which is common in real studies, negative branch
    lengths may be produced, challenging interpretation and subsequent analyses. To
    address this issue, this function converts negative branch lengths into zeros by
    default, but this behavior can be disabled by setting ``clip_to_zero`` to False.

    Gascuel and Steel (2006) provide a detailed overview of neighbor joining in terms
    of its biological relevance and limitations [2]_. They proved that NJ is a greedy
    heuristic to the balanced minimum evolution (BME) problem. An alternative method
    to this problem is provided by :func:`bme`.

    The example presented here is derived from the Wikipedia page on neighbor joining
    [3]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a new distance matrix object describing the distances between five
    taxa: a, b, c, d, and e.

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.tree import nj

    >>> data = [[0,  5,  9,  9,  8],
    ...         [5,  0, 10, 10,  9],
    ...         [9, 10,  0,  8,  7],
    ...         [9, 10,  8,  0,  3],
    ...         [8,  9,  7,  3,  0]]
    >>> ids = list('abcde')
    >>> dm = DistanceMatrix(data, ids)

    Construct the neighbor joining tree representing the relationship between
    those taxa. This is returned as a TreeNode object.

    >>> tree = nj(dm)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())
