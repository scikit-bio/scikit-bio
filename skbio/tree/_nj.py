def nj(dm, disallow_negative_branch_length=True, result_constructor=None):
    r"""Apply neighbor joining for phylogenetic reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm : skbio.DistanceMatrix
        Input distance matrix containing distances between taxa.
    disallow_negative_branch_length : bool, optional
        Neighbor joining can result in negative branch lengths, which don't
        make sense in an evolutionary context. If `True`, negative branch
        lengths will be returned as zero, a common strategy for handling this
        issue that was proposed by the original developers of the algorithm.
    result_constructor : function, optional
        Function to apply to construct the result object. This must take a
        newick-formatted string as input. The result of applying this function
        to a newick-formatted string will be returned from this function. This
        defaults to ``lambda x: TreeNode.read(StringIO(x), format='newick')``.

    Returns
    -------
    TreeNode
        By default, the result object is a `TreeNode`, though this can be
        overridden by passing `result_constructor`.

    --------
    TreeNode.root_at_midpoint

    Notes
    -----
    Neighbor joining was initially described in Saitou and Nei (1987) [1]_. The
    example presented here is derived from the Wikipedia page on neighbor
    joining [2]_. Gascuel and Steel (2006) provide a detailed overview of
    Neighbor joining in terms of its biological relevance and limitations [3]_.

    Neighbor joining, by definition, creates unrooted trees. One strategy for
    rooting the resulting trees is midpoint rooting, which is accessible as
    ``TreeNode.root_at_midpoint``.

    Examples
    --------
    Define a new distance matrix object describing the distances between five
    taxa: a, b, c, d, and e.

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.tree import nj

    >>> data = [[0,  5,  9,  9,  8],
    ...         [5,  0, 10, 10,  9],
    ...         [9, 10,  0,  8,  7],
    ...         [9, 10,  8,  0,  3],
    ...         [8,  9,  7,  3,  0]]
    >>> ids = list('abcde')
    >>> dm = DistanceMatrix(data, ids)

    Construct the neighbor joining tree representing the relationship between
    those taxa. This is returned as a TreeNode object.

    >>> tree = nj(dm)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())
              /-d
             |
             |          /-c

             |
              \-e

    Again, construct the neighbor joining tree, but instead return the newick
    string representing the tree, rather than the TreeNode object. (Note that
    in this example the string output is truncated when printed to facilitate
    rendering.)
