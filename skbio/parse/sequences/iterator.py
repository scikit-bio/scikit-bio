class SequenceIterator(Workflow):
    """Provide a standard API for interacting with sequence data

    Provide a common interface for iterating over sequence data, including
    support for quality scores and transforms.

    A transform method is a function that takes the state dict and modifies it
    in place. For instance, to reverse sequences, you could pass in the
    following function:

    >>> def reverse(st):
    ...    st['Sequence']= st['Sequence'][::-1]
    ...    st['Qual'] = st['Qual'][::-1] if st['Qual'] is not None else None

    as ``transform``. The primary intention is to support reverse complementing
    of sequences.

    All subclasses of this object are expected to update the following in
    ``state``:

        * SequenceID : str, the sequence identifier
        * Sequence   : str, the sequence itself
        * QualID     : str or None, the quality ID (for completeness)
        * Qual       : np.array or None, the quality scores

    ``state`` is preallocated a single time to avoid repetitive allocations.
    What this means is that the object being yielded is updated in place. If
    an individual record needs to be tracked over time, then it is recommended
    that copies of the yielded data are made.

    *WARNING*: The yielded obj is not safe for use with Python 2.7's builtin
    `zip` method as the state is updated in place.

    Parameters
    ----------

    seq : list of open file-like objects
    qual : list of open file-like objects or None
    transform : function or None
        If provided, this function will be passed ``state``
    valid_id : bool
        If true, verify sequence and qual IDs are identical (if relevant)
    valid_length : bool
        If true, verify the length of the sequence and qual are the same
        (if relevant)
