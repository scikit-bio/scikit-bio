"""Parsers for tree formats.

Implementation Notes

The algorithm used here is fairly general: should possibly make the code
generalizable to tree strings that use alternative delimiters and symbols.
However, I can't think of any cases where alternatives are used, so this is
left to future work.

Should possibly build a dict of {label:TreeNode} while parsing to make it
convenient to fill in additional data later, e.g. to fill in sequences from
their numeric labels in Newick format. Alternatively, maybe TreeNode should
get a buildIndex() method that performs the equivalent task.

As of 12/27/03, should be capable of parsing the ClustalW .dnd files without
difficulty.
