"""Construct a TabularMSA from a string representation of a multiple sequence alignment.\n\nArgs:\n    source (str): Input data in the format of a multiple sequence alignment. \n    constructor (callable): A callable that constructs a TabularMSA from\n        provided data.\n\nReturns:\n    TabularMSA: A TabularMSA constructed from the provided source.\n\nRaises:\n    ValueError: If the source data is invalid or cannot be parsed.\n\nNotes:\n    This function is primarily intended for use with the sequence alignment\n    data formats supported by Bio.SeqIO, but other formats may be acceptable\n    as long as they can be converted into a TabularMSA.\n"""
