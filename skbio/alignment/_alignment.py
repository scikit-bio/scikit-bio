        The default behavior can be useful when writing sequences out for use

        .. [1] RAxML Version 8: A tool for Phylogenetic Analysis and
           Post-Analysis of Large Phylogenies". In Bioinformatics, 2014

        Examples
        --------
        Define a sequence collection containing two sequences with IDs "abc"
        and "def":

        >>> from skbio import DNA, SequenceCollection
        >>> sequences = [DNA('A--CCGT.', id="abc"),

        >>> s1 = SequenceCollection(sequences)
        >>> s1.ids()
        ['abc', 'def']

        Update the IDs in the sequence collection, obtaining a new sequence
        collection with IDs that are integer-based:

        >>> s2, new_to_old_ids = s1.update_ids()
        >>> s2.ids()
        ['1', '2']

        Alternatively, we can specify a function to map the current IDs to new
        IDs. Let's define a function that appends ``'-new'`` to each ID:

        >>> def id_mapper(ids):
        ...     return [id_ + '-new' for id_ in ids]
        >>> s3, new_to_old_ids = s1.update_ids(func=id_mapper)
        >>> s3.ids()
        ['abc-new', 'def-new']

        We can also directly update the IDs with a new sequence of IDs:

        >>> s4, new_to_old_ids = s1.update_ids(ids=['ghi', 'jkl'])
        >>> s4.ids()
        ['ghi', 'jkl']

    The ``Alignment`` class adds methods to the ``SequenceCollection`` class
    that are useful for working with aligned biological sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seqs : list of `skbio.Sequence` objects
        The `skbio.Sequence` objects to load into a new `Alignment` object.
    validate : bool, optional
        If True, runs the `is_valid` method after construction and raises
        `SequenceCollectionError` if ``is_valid == False``.
    score : float, optional
        The score of the alignment, if applicable (usually only if the
        alignment was just constructed).
    start_end_positions : iterable of two-item tuples, optional
        The start and end positions of each input sequence in the alignment,
        if applicable (usually only if the alignment was just constructed using
        a local alignment algorithm). Note that these should be indexes into
        the unaligned sequences, though the `Alignment` object itself doesn't
        know about these unless it is degapped.

    Raises
    ------
    skbio.SequenceCollectionError
        If ``validate == True`` and ``is_valid == False``.
    skbio.AlignmentError
        If not all the sequences have the same length.

    Notes
    -----
    By definition, all of the sequences in an alignment must be of the same
    length. For this reason, an alignment can be thought of as a matrix of
    sequences (rows) by positions (columns).

        The start/end positions indicate the range of the unaligned sequences

        the second sequence were not included in the alignment, and the
        aligned sequences were therefore:
        ACA
        ACA
