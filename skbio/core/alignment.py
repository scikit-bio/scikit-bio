Sequence collections and alignments (:mod:`skbio.core.alignment`)
=================================================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.core.alignment

This module provides functionality for working with biological sequence
collections and alignments. These can be composed of generic sequences,
nucelotide sequences, DNA sequences, and RNA sequences. By default, input is
not validated, except that sequence ids must be unique, but all
contructor methods take a validate option which checks different features of
the input based on ``SequenceCollection`` type.

        Returns
        -------
        skbio.core.sequence.BiologicalSequence
            The consensus sequence of the `Alignment`. In other words, at each
            position the most common character is chosen, and those characters
            are combined to create a new sequence.

        Notes
        -----
        If there are two characters that are equally abundant in the sequence
        at a given position, the choice of which of those characters will be
        present at that position in the result is arbitrary.
