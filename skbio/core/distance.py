Distance matrices (:mod:`skbio.core.distance`)
==============================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.core.distance

This module provides functionality for serializing, deserializing, and
manipulating distance matrices in memory. There are multiple distance matrix
classes available, where the appropriate class to use depends on the nature of
the distances you wish to store.

A distance matrix includes both a matrix of distances (floats) between objects,
as well as IDs (object labels; strings) identifying each object in the matrix.

Classes

   :toctree: generated/

   DistanceMatrix
   SymmetricDistanceMatrix

Functions

   randdm

Examples
--------
Assume we have the following delimited text file::

    \ta\tb\tc
    a\t0.0\t0.5\t1.0
    b\t0.5\t0.0\t0.75
    c\t1.0\t0.75\t0.0

Load a distance matrix from the file:

>>> from StringIO import StringIO
>>> from skbio.core.distance import DistanceMatrix
>>> dm_f = StringIO("\ta\tb\tc\n"
...                 "a\t0.0\t0.5\t1.0\n"
...                 "b\t0.5\t0.0\t0.75\n"
...                 "c\t1.0\t0.75\t0.0\n")
>>> dm = DistanceMatrix.from_file(dm_f)
>>> print dm
3x3 distance matrix
IDs:
a, b, c
Data:
[[ 0.    0.5   1.  ]
 [ 0.5   0.    0.75]
 [ 1.    0.75  0.  ]]

Access the distance (scalar) between objects ``'a'`` and ``'c'``:

>>> dm['a', 'c']
1.0

Get a row vector of distances between object ``'b'`` and all other objects:

>>> dm['b']
array([ 0.5 ,  0.  ,  0.75])

numpy indexing/slicing also works as expected. Extract the third column:

>>> dm[:, 2]
array([ 1.  ,  0.75,  0.  ])

Serialize the distance matrix to delimited text file:

>>> out_f = StringIO()
>>> dm.to_file(out_f)
>>> out_f.getvalue()
'\ta\tb\tc\na\t0.0\t0.5\t1.0\nb\t0.5\t0.0\t0.75\nc\t1.0\t0.75\t0.0\n'
>>> out_f.getvalue() == dm_f.getvalue()
True

    """Store distances between objects and object IDs.

    A `DistanceMatrix` instance stores a square, hollow, two-dimensional matrix
    of distances between objects. Objects could be, for example, samples or DNA
    sequences. A sequence of IDs accompanies the distances.

    Methods are provided to load and save distance matrices from/to disk, as
    well as perform common operations such as extracting distances based on ID.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like or DistanceMatrix
        Square, hollow, two-dimensional ``numpy.ndarray`` of distances
        (floats), or a structure that can be converted to a ``numpy.ndarray``
        using ``numpy.asarray``. Can instead be a `DistanceMatrix` instance, in
        which case the distance matrix's data will be used. Data will be
        converted to a float ``dtype`` if necessary. A copy will *not* be made
        if already a ``numpy.ndarray`` with a float ``dtype``.
    ids : sequence of str
        Sequence of strings to be used as object IDs. Must match the number of
        rows/cols in `data`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data
    ids
    dtype
    shape
    size
    T

    --------
    SymmetricDistanceMatrix

    Notes
    -----
    The distances are stored in redundant (square-form) format [1]_.

    The data are not checked for symmetry, nor guaranteed/assumed to be
    symmetric.

    References
    ----------

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize a `skbio.core.distance.DistanceMatrix` object from an existing
    ``numpy.array`` that represents the distances between three samples with
    IDs a, b, and c:

        0.0\t0.5\t1.0
        0.5\t0.0\t0.75

        """Load distance matrix from delimited text file.

        Creates a `DistanceMatrix` instance from a serialized distance
        matrix stored as delimited text.

        `dm_f` must be a file-like object containing delimited text. The first
        line (header) must contain the IDs of each object. The subsequent lines
        must contain an ID followed by each distance (float) between the
        current object and all other objects, where the order of objects is
        determined by the header line.

        For example, a 2x2 distance matrix with IDs ``'a'`` and ``'b'`` might
        look like::

            <del>a<del>b
            a<del>0.0<del>1.0
            b<del>1.0<del>0.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        dm_f : iterable of str
            Iterable of strings (e.g., open file handle, file-like object, list
            of strings, etc.) containing a serialized distance matrix.
        delimiter : str, optional
            String delimiting elements in `dm_f`.

        Returns
        -------
        DistanceMatrix
            Instance of type `cls` containing the parsed contents of `dm_f`.

        Notes
        -----
        Whitespace-only lines can occur anywhere throughout the "file" and are
        ignored. Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments and ignored.
        These comments can only occur *before* the ID header.

        IDs will have any leading/trailing whitespace removed when they are
        parsed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        index : str, two-tuple of str, or numpy index
            `index` can be one of the following forms: an ID, a pair of IDs, or
            a numpy index.

            If `index` is a string, it is assumed to be an ID and a
            ``numpy.ndarray`` row vector is returned for the corresponding ID.
            Note that the ID's row of distances is returned, *not* its column.
            If the matrix is symmetric, the two will be identical, but this
            makes a difference if the matrix is asymmetric.

            If `index` is a two-tuple of strings, each string is assumed to be

            represents the distance between the two IDs. Note that the order of
            lookup by ID pair matters if the matrix is asymmetric: the first ID
            will be used to look up the row, and the second ID will be used to
            look up the column. Thus, ``dm['a', 'b']`` may not be the same as
            ``dm['b', 'a']`` if the matrix is asymmetric.

            Otherwise, `index` will be passed through to
            ``DistanceMatrix.data.__getitem__``, allowing for standard indexing
            of a ``numpy.ndarray`` (e.g., slicing).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_objects : int
        The number of objects in the resulting distance matrix. For example, if
        `num_objects` is 3, a 3x3 distance matrix will be returned.
    ids : sequence of str or None, optional
        A sequence of strings to be used as IDs. ``len(ids)`` must be equal to

        integers cast as strings (numbering starts at 1). For example,

    constructor : type, optional
        `DistanceMatrix` or subclass constructor to use when creating the
        random distance matrix. The returned distance matrix will be of this
        type. If ``None`` (the default), a `DistanceMatrix` instance will be
        returned.
    random_fn : function, optional
        Function to generate random values. `random_fn` must accept two
        arguments (number of rows and number of columns) and return a 2D
        ``numpy.ndarray`` of floats (or something that can be cast to float).
        If ``None`` (the default), ``numpy.random.rand`` will be used.

    DistanceMatrix
