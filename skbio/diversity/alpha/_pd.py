    The Faith's PD metric is defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = \sum_{b \in T \sqcup R} l(b)

    where :math:`T` is a minimum set of branches (:math:`b`) in a rooted tree
    that connect all taxa in a community. :math:`R` is a set of branches from
    the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the taxa to the root of the tree.
    :math:`PD` is the sum of lengths (:math:`l`) of branches in both sets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 1-D array_like, int
        Vectors of counts/abundances of taxa for one sample.
    taxa : list, np.array
        Vector of taxon IDs corresponding to tip names in ``tree``. Must be the
        same length as ``counts``. Required.
    tree : skbio.TreeNode
        Tree relating taxa. The set of tip names in the tree can be a superset
        of ``taxa``, but not a subset. Required.
    validate: bool, optional
        If ``False``, validation of the input won't be performed. This step can
        be slow, so if validation is run elsewhere it can be disabled here.
        However, invalid input data can lead to invalid results or error
        messages that are hard to interpret, so this step should not be
        bypassed if you're not certain that your input data are valid. See
        :mod:`skbio.diversity` for the description of what validation entails
        so you can determine if you can safely disable validation.
    otu_ids : list, np.array
        Alias of ``taxa`` for backward compatibility. Deprecated and to be
        removed in a future release.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError, MissingNodeError, DuplicateNodeError
        If validation fails. Exact error will depend on what was invalid.

    Notes
    -----
    Faith's phylogenetic diversity, often referred to as PD, was originally
    described in [1]_. It is the total phylogenetic branch length spanning
    all taxa of a community.

    It was clarified that the calculation should extend to the root of the
    tree [2]_, such that a single-taxon community will not have PD = 0. The
    root should be ancestral to all taxa being considered in the study, but
    does not need to be the origin of life. One should choose the root
    according to the scope of the study.

    Unrooted and abundance-weighted variants of PD are implemented in
    ``phydiv``.

    Several other metrics, such as evolutionary history (EH) [3]_ and
    functional diversity (FD) [4]_, are equivalent to PD in calculation.

    If computing Faith's PD for multiple samples, using
    ``skbio.diversity.alpha_diversity`` will be much faster than calling this
    function individually on each sample.

    This implementation of Faith's PD is based on the array-based
    implementation of UniFrac described in [5]_.

    This implementation differs from that in PyCogent (and therefore QIIME
    versions less than 2.0.0) by imposing a few additional restrictions on the
    inputs. First, the input tree must be rooted. In PyCogent, if an unrooted
    tree was provided that had a single trifurcating node (a newick convention
    for unrooted trees) that node was considered the root of the tree. Next,
    all taxa must be tips in the tree. PyCogent would silently ignore taxa that
    were not present the tree. To reproduce Faith PD results from PyCogent with
    scikit-bio, ensure that your PyCogent Faith PD calculations are performed
    on a rooted tree and that all taxa are present in the tree.

    Examples
    --------
    Assume we have the following abundance data for a sample ``u``, represented
    as a counts vector. These counts represent the number of times specific
    taxa were observed in the sample.

    >>> u_counts = [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0]

    Because Faith PD is a phylogenetic diversity metric, we need to know which
    taxon each count corresponds to, which we'll provide as ``taxa``.

    >>> taxa = ['U1', 'U2', 'U3', 'U4', 'U5', 'U6', 'U7', 'U8']

    We also need a phylogenetic tree that relates the taxa to one another.

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> from skbio import TreeNode
    >>> tree = TreeNode.read(StringIO(
    ...                      '(((((U1:0.5,U2:0.5):0.5,U3:1.0):1.0):0.0,'
    ...                      '(U4:0.75,(U5:0.5,((U6:0.33,U7:0.62):0.5'
    ...                      ',U8:0.5):0.5):0.5):1.25):0.0)root;'))

    We can then compute the Faith PD of the sample.

    >>> pd = faith_pd(u_counts, taxa, tree)

    Notes
    -----
    Phylogenetic diversity (PD) metrics measure the diversity of a community
    with consideration of the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. In
    general, PD is the sum of branch lengths spanning across taxa, optionally
    weighted by their abundance.

    The most widely-adopted PD metric, Faith's PD [1]_, is defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = \sum_{b \in T \sqcup R} l(b)

    where :math:`T` is a minimum set of branches (:math:`b`) in a rooted tree
    that connect all taxa in a community. :math:`R` is a set of branches from
    the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the taxa to the root of the tree.
    :math:`PD` is the sum of lengths (:math:`l`) of branches in both sets.

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=True, weight=False)``.

    A variant of PD, which does not include the root in the calculation, was
    referred to by some authors as unrooted phylogenetic diversity (uPD) [2]_,
    as in contrast to rooted phylogenetic diversity (rPD, i.e., Faith's PD).
    uPD is defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = \sum_{b \in T} l(b)

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=False, weight=False)``.

    See ``faith_pd`` for a discussion of the root.

    PD (rooted or unrooted) considers only the presence of taxa. Therefore, it
    can be considered as the phylogenetic generalization of species richness.
    However, there are advantages of incorporating abundance information in the
    measurement [3]_. A generalized framework of abundance-weighted PD is
    provided in [4]_.

    Abundance-weighted rooted PD (equivalent to :math:`RBWPD_{1}` described in
    [4]_) is analogous to the :math:`PD_{aw}` metric originally described in
    [5]_ with a multiplier. It is defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = \sum_{b \in T \sqcup R} l(b) p(b)

    where :math:`p` is the sum of relative (proportional) abundances of taxa
    descending from branch (:math:`b`).

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=True, weight=True)``.

    Abundance-weighted unrooted PD (equivalent to :math:`BWPD_{1}` described in
    [4]_) is analogous to the :math:`\delta nPD` metric originally described in
    [6]_ with a multiplier. It is defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = 2 \sum_{b \in T} l(b) \min(p(b),1-p(b))

    In which the term :math:`2\min(p(b),1-p(b))` is the lesser of the relative
    abundance of descending taxa on either side of a branch, multiplied by two.
    It is referred to as the "balance" of taxon abundance in [4]_.

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=False, weight=True)``.

    The contribution of taxon abundance to the metric can be adjusted using the
    ``weighted`` parameter when it is a float within [0, 1]. This factor was
    referred to as :math:`\theta` in [4]_. The metric, :math:`BWPD_{\theta}`,
    referred to as the balance-weighted phylogenetic diversity in [4]_, is
    defined as:

    .. math::

       PD = \sum_{b \in T} l(b) (2\min(p(b),1-p(b)))^\theta

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=False, weight=theta)``.

    This metric falls back to unweighted PD when :math:`\theta=0` or fully-
    weighted PD when :math:`\theta=1`. The original publication tested
    :math:`\theta=0.25` or :math:`0.5` [4]_.

    The parameter :math:`\theta` is analogous to the parameter :math:`\alpha`
    in the generalized UniFrac metric [7]_.

    Likewise, the rooted version of balance-weighted phylogenetic diversity,
    :math:`RBWPD_{\theta}` [4]_ (although "balance" is not involved), is
    defined as:

    .. math::

        PD = \sum_{b \in T \sqcup R} l(b) p(b)^\theta

    It is equivalent to ``pd(..., rooted=True, weight=theta)``.

    It is important to report which metric is used. For practical perspective,
    we recommend the following denotions:

    - :math:`rPD`: rooted, unweighted PD (Faith's PD [1]_).
    - :math:`uPD`: unrooted, unweighted PD (uPD [2]_).
    - :math:`rPD_{w}`: rooted, weighted PD (analogous to
      :math:`PD_{aw}` [3]_).
    - :math:`uPD_{w}`: unrooted, weighted PD (analogous to
      :math:`\delta nPD` [4]_).
    - :math:`rPD_{w\theta}`: rooted, weighted PD with parameter
      :math:`\theta` (:math:`RBWPD_{\theta}` [5]_).
    - :math:`uPD_{w\theta}`: unrooted, weighted PD with parameter
      :math:`\theta` (:math:`BWPD_{\theta}` [5]_).
