Alpha diversity measures (:mod:`skbio.diversity.alpha`)
=======================================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.diversity.alpha

This package provides implementations of various alpha diversity measures,
including measures of richness, dominance, and evenness. Some functions
generate confidence intervals (CIs). These functions have the suffix ``_ci``.

All alpha diversity measures accept a vector of counts within a single sample,
where each count is, for example, the number of observations of a particular
Operational Taxonomic Unit, or OTU. We use the term "OTU" here very loosely, as
these could be counts of any type of feature/observation (e.g., bacterial
species). We'll refer to this vector as the *counts vector* or simply *counts*
throughout the documentation.

The counts vector must be one-dimensional and contain integers representing the
number of individuals seen (or *counted*) for a particular OTU. Negative values
are not allowed; the counts vector may only contain integers greater than or
equal to zero.

The counts vector is `array_like`: anything that can be converted into a 1-D
numpy array is acceptable input. For example, you can provide a numpy array or
a native Python list and the results should be identical.

If the input to an alpha diversity measure does not meet the above
requirements, the function will raise either a ``ValueError`` or a
``TypeError``, depending on the condition that is violated.

.. note:: There are different ways that samples are represented in the
   ecological literature and in related software. The alpha diversity measures
   provided here *always* assume that the input contains abundance data: each
   count represents the number of individuals seen for a particular OTU in the
   sample. For example, if you have two OTUs, where 3 individuals were observed
   from one of the OTUs and only a single individual was observed from the
   other, you could represent this data in the following forms (among others):

   As a vector of counts. This is the expected type of input for the alpha
   diversity measures in this module. There are 3 individuals from the OTU at
   index 0, and 1 individual from the OTU at index 1:

   >>> counts = [3, 1]

   As a vector of indices. The OTU at index 0 is observed 3 times, while the
   OTU at index 1 is observed 1 time:

   >>> indices = [0, 0, 0, 1]

   As a vector of frequencies. We have 1 OTU that is a singleton and 1 OTU that
   is a tripleton. We do not have any 0-tons or doubletons:

   >>> frequencies = [0, 1, 0, 1]

   Always use the first representation (a counts vector) with this module.

Examples
--------

>>> import numpy as np

Assume we have the following abundance data for a sample, represented as a
counts vector:

>>> counts = [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0]

We can count the number of OTUs:

>>> observed_otus(counts)
5

Note that OTUs with counts of zero are ignored.

In the previous example, we provided a Python list as input. We can also
provide other types of input that are `array_like`:

>>> observed_otus((1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0)) # tuple
5
>>> observed_otus(np.array([1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0])) # numpy array
5

All of the alpha diversity measures work in this manner.

Other metrics include ``singles``, which tells us how many OTUs are observed
exactly one time (i.e., are *singleton* OTUs), and ``doubles``, which tells us
how many OTUs are observed exactly two times (i.e., are *doubleton* OTUs).
Let's see how many singletons and doubletons there are in the sample:

>>> singles(counts)
2
>>> doubles(counts)
1
