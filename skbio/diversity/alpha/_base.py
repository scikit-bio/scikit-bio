def dominance(counts, finite=False):
    r"""Calculate Simpson's dominance index.

    Simpson's dominance index, a.k.a. Simpson's :math:`D`, measures the degree
    of concentration of taxon composition of a sample. It is defined as:

    .. math::

       D = \sum_{i=1}^S{p_i^2}

    where :math:`S` is the number of taxa and :math:`p_i` is the proportion
    of the sample represented by taxon :math:`i`.

    Simpson's :math:`D` ranges from 0 (infinite diversity; no dominance) and 1
    (complete dominance, no diversity).

    Simpson's :math:`D` can be interpreted as the probability that two randomly
    selected individuals belong to the same taxon.

    Simpson's :math:`D` may be corrected for finite samples to account for the
    effect of sampling without replacement. This more accurately represents the
    above probability when the sample is small. It is calculated as:

    .. math::

       D = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^s{n_i(n_i - 1))}}{N(N - 1)}

    where :math:`n_i` is the number of individuals in the :math:`i^{\text{th}}`
    taxon and :math:`N` is the total number of individuals in the sample.

    Simpson's :math:`D` is sometimes referred to as "Simpson's index". It
    should be noted that :math:`D` is not a measure of community diversity. It
    is also important to distinguish :math:`D` from Simpson's diversity index
    (:math:`1 - D`) and inverse Simpson index (:math:`1 / D`), both of which
    are measures of community diversity.

    Discrepancy exists among literature in using the term "Simpson index" and
    the denotion :math:`D`. It is therefore important to distinguish these
    metrics according to their mathematic definition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 1-D array_like, int
        Vector of counts.
    finite : bool, optional
        If ``True``, correct for finite sampling.

    Kempton-Taylor Q index measures diversity based on the middle-ranking taxa

    .. math::

       Q = \frac{S_{lower..upper}}{\ln n_{lower} - \ln n_{upper}}

    By default, the lower and upper quartiles are used. Therefore:

    The quantiles are rounded inwards in this implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 1-D array_like, int
        Vector of counts.
    lower_quantile : float, optional
        Lower bound of the interquantile range. Defaults to lower quartile.
    upper_quantile : float, optional
        Upper bound of the interquantile range. Defaults to upper quartile.

    Returns
    -------
    float

    Notes
    -----
    The index is defined in [1]_. The implementation here is based on the
    description given in the SDR-IV online manual [2]_.

    The implementation provided here differs slightly from the results given in
    Magurran 1998. Specifically, we have 14 in the numerator rather than 15.
    Magurran recommends counting half of the taxa with the same # counts as the
    point where the UQ falls and the point where the LQ falls, but the
    justification for this is unclear (e.g. if there were a very large # taxa
    that just overlapped one of the quantiles, the results would be
    considerably off). Leaving the calculation as-is for now, but consider
    changing.

    observation. It is defined as:

    .. math::

       S = \frac{nS_{max}}{n+B}

    where :math:`n` is the number of individuals and :math:`S` is the number of
    taxa. This function estimates the :math:`S_{max}` parameter.

    The fit is made to datapoints for :math:`n=1,2,...,N`, where :math:`N` is
    the total number of individuals (sum of abundances for all taxa).
    :math:`S` is the number of taxa represented in a random sample of
    :math:`n` individuals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 1-D array_like, int
        Vector of counts.
    num_repeats : int, optional
        The number of times to perform rarefaction (subsampling without
        replacement) at each value of :math:`n`.
    params_guess : tuple, optional
        Initial guess of :math:`S_{max}` and :math:`B`. If ``None``, default
        guess for :math:`S_{max}` is :math:`S` (as :math:`S_{max}` should
        be >= :math:`S`) and default guess for :math:`B` is ``round(N / 2)``.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Estimate of the :math:`S_{max}` parameter in the Michaelis-Menten
        equation.

    See Also
    --------
    skbio.stats.subsample_counts

    Notes
    -----
    There is some controversy about how to do the fitting. The ML model given
    in [1]_ is based on the assumption that error is roughly proportional to
    magnitude of observation, reasonable for enzyme kinetics but not reasonable
    for rarefaction data. Here we just do a nonlinear curve fit for the
    parameters using least-squares.

    Shannon's diversity index, :math:`H'`, a.k.a., Shannon index, or Shannon-
    Wiener index, is equivalent to entropy in information theory. It is defined

    .. math::

       H' = -\sum_{i=1}^S\left(p_i\log_b(p_i)\right)

    where :math:`S` is the number of taxa and :math:`p_i` is the proportion

    The logarithm base :math:`b` defaults to ``e``, but may be 2, 10 or other
    custom values.

    The exponential of Shannon index, :math:`exp(H')`, measures the effective
    number of species (a.k.a., true diversity). It is equivalent to perplexity
    in information theory, or Hill number with order 1 (:math:`^1D`). The value
    is independent from the base:

            The default logarithm base was changed from 2 to :math:`e` for

    Therefore, Simpson's diversity index is also denoted as :math:`1 - D`, in

    Simpson's diversity index can be interpreted as the probability that two
