    Magurran recommends counting half of the OTUs with the same # counts as the

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 1-D array_like, int
        Vector of counts.

    Returns
    -------
    double
        Robbins' estimate.

    Notes
    -----
    Robbins' estimator is defined in [1]_. The estimate computed here is for
    :math:`n-1` counts, i.e. the x-axis is off by 1.
