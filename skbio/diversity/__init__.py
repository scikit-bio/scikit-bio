r"""Community Diversity (:mod:`skbio.diversity`)
============================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.diversity

This module provides functionality for analyzing biodiversity of communities
-- groups of organisms living in the same area. It implements various metrics
of alpha (within-community) and beta (between-community) diversity, and
provides "driver functions" for computing alpha and beta diversity for an
entire data table. Additional utilities are provided to support discovery of
available diversity metrics. While diversity metrics were originally designed
to study biological communities, they can be generalized to the analysis of
various biological data types.

Introduction
------------

A community (i.e., sample) is represented by a vector of frequencies of taxa
within the sample. The term "taxon" (plural: "taxa") describes a group of
biologically related organisms that constitute a unit in the community. Taxa
are usually defined at a uniform taxonomic rank, such as species, genus or
family. In community ecology, taxon is usually referred to as "species"
(singular = plural), but its definition is not limited to species as a
taxonomic rank. The term "taxonomic group" is a synonym of taxon in many
situations.

In scikit-bio, the term "taxon/taxa" is used very loosely, as these can in
practice represent diverse feature types including organisms, genes, and
metabolites. The term "sample" is also loosely defined for these purposes.
These are intended to represent a single unit of sampling, and as such what a
single sample represents can vary widely. For example, in a microbiome survey,
these could represent all 16S rRNA gene sequences from a single oral swab. In
a comparative genomics study on the other hand, a sample could represent an
individual organism's genome.

.. note::

   Previous versions of scikit-bio referred to taxon as operational taxonomic
   unit (OTU), a historically important term in microbiome research. However,
   as the field advances and the research targets diverge (e.g., amplicon
   sequence variant, or ASV), a more generic term such as "taxon" becomes more
   appropriate. Therefore, the term OTU was replaced by taxon in scikit-bio
   0.6.0.

Each frequency in a given vector represents the number of individuals observed
for a particular taxon. We will refer to the frequencies associated with a
single sample as a *counts vector* or ``counts`` throughout the documentation.
Counts vectors are `array_like`: anything that can be converted into a 1-D
numpy array is acceptable input. For example, you can provide a numpy array or
a native Python list and the results will be identical.

The driver functions :func:`alpha_diversity` and :func:`beta_diversity` are
designed to compute alpha diversity for one or more samples, or beta diversity
for one or more pairs of samples. The driver functions accept a matrix
containing vectors of frequencies of taxa within each sample. Each row in the
matrix represents a single sample's count vector, so that rows represent
samples and columns represent taxa.

Some diversity metrics incorporate relationships between the taxa in their
computation through reference to a phylogenetic tree. These metrics
additionally take a :class:`skbio.TreeNode` object and a list of taxa mapping
the values in the counts vector to tips in the tree.

The driver functions are optimized so that computing a diversity metric more
than one time (i.e., for more than one sample for alpha diversity metrics, or
more than one pair of samples for beta diversity metrics) is often much faster
than repeated calls to the metric. For this reason, the driver functions take
matrices of counts vectors rather than a single counts vector for alpha
diversity metrics or two counts vectors for beta diversity metrics. The
``alpha_diversity`` driver function will thus compute alpha diversity for all
counts vectors in the matrix, and the ``beta_diversity`` driver function will
compute beta diversity for all pairs of counts vectors in the matrix.

Input validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver functions perform validation of input by default. Validation can be
slow so it is possible to disable this step by passing ``validate=False``. This
can be dangerous however. If invalid input is encountered when validation is
disabled it can result in difficult-to-interpret error messages or incorrect
results. We therefore recommend that users are careful to ensure that their
input data is valid before disabling validation.

The conditions that the driver functions validate follow. If disabling
validation, users should be confident that these conditions are met.

* the data in the counts vectors can be safely cast to integers
* there are no negative values in the counts vectors
* each counts vector is one dimensional
* the counts matrix is two dimensional
* all counts vectors are of equal length

Additionally, if a phylogenetic diversity metric is being computed, the
following conditions are also confirmed:

* the provided taxa are all unique
* the length of each counts vector is equal to the number of taxa
* the provided tree is rooted
* the tree has more than one node
* all nodes in the provided tree except for the root node have branch lengths
* all tip names in the provided tree are unique
* all provided taxa correspond to tip names in the provided tree

Count vectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are different ways that count vectors are represented in the ecological
literature and in related software. The diversity measures provided here
*always* assume that the input contains abundance data: each count represents
the number of individuals observed for a particular taxon in the sample. For
example, if you have two taxa, where three individuals were observed from the
first taxon and only a single individual was observed from the second taxon,
you could represent this data in the following forms (among others).

As a vector of counts. This is the expected type of input for the diversity
measures in this module. There are 3 individuals from the taxon at index 0,
and 1 individual from the taxon at index 1:

>>> counts = [3, 1]

As a vector of indices. The taxon at index 0 is observed 3 times, while the
taxon at index 1 is observed 1 time:

>>> indices = [0, 0, 0, 1]

As a vector of frequencies. We have 1 taxon that is a singleton and 1 taxon
that is a tripleton. We do not have any 0-tons or doubletons:

>>> frequencies = [0, 1, 0, 1]

Always use the first representation (a counts vector) with this module.

Specifying a diversity metric
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver functions take a parameter, ``metric``, that specifies which
diversity metric should be applied. The value that you provide for ``metric``
can be either a string (e.g., ``"faith_pd"``) or a function (e.g.,
``skbio.diversity.alpha.faith_pd``). The metric should generally be passed as a
string, as this often uses an optimized version of the metric. For example,
passing  ``metric="faith_pd"`` (a string) to ``alpha_diversity`` will be tens
of times faster than passing ``metric=skbio.diversity.alpha.faith_pd`` (a
function) when computing Faith's PD on about 100 samples.  Similarly, passing
``metric="unweighted_unifrac"`` (a string) will be hundreds of times
faster than passing ``metric=skbio.diversity.beta.unweighted_unifrac`` (a
function) when computing unweighted UniFrac on about 100 samples. The latter
may be faster if computing only one alpha or beta diversity value, but in
these cases the run times will likely be so small that the difference will be
negligible. **We therefore recommend that you always pass the metric as a
string when possible.**

Passing a metric as a string will not be possible if the metric you'd like to
run is not one that scikit-bio knows about. This might be the case, for
example, if you're applying a custom metric that you've developed. To discover
the metric names that scikit-bio knows about as strings that can be passed as
``metric`` to ``alpha_diversity`` or ``beta_diversity``, you can call
``get_alpha_diversity_metrics`` or ``get_beta_diversity_metrics``,
respectively. These functions return lists of alpha and beta diversity metrics
that are implemented in scikit-bio. There may be additional metrics that can be
passed as strings which won't be listed here, such as those implemented in
``scipy.spatial.distance.pdist``.


Tutorial
--------
Create a matrix containing 6 samples (rows) and 7 taxa (columns):

.. plot::
   :context:

   >>> data = [[23, 64, 14, 0, 0, 3, 1],
   ...         [0, 3, 35, 42, 0, 12, 1],
   ...         [0, 5, 5, 0, 40, 40, 0],
   ...         [44, 35, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0],
   ...         [0, 2, 8, 0, 35, 45, 1],
   ...         [0, 0, 25, 35, 0, 19, 0]]
   >>> ids = list('ABCDEF')

   First, we'll compute :math:`S_{obs}`, an alpha diversity metric, for each
   sample using the ``alpha_diversity`` driver function:

   >>> from skbio.diversity import alpha_diversity
   >>> adiv_sobs = alpha_diversity('sobs', data, ids)
   >>> adiv_sobs
   A    5
   B    5
   C    4
   D    4
   E    5
   F    3
   dtype: int64

   Next we'll compute Faith's PD on the same samples. Since this is a
   phylogenetic diversity metric, we'll first create a tree and an ordered
   list of taxa.

   >>> from skbio import TreeNode
   >>> from io import StringIO
   >>> tree = TreeNode.read(StringIO(
   ...                      '(((((U1:0.5,U2:0.5):0.5,U3:1.0):1.0):0.0,'
   ...                      '(U4:0.75,(U5:0.5,(U6:0.5,U7:0.5):0.5):'
   ...                      '0.5):1.25):0.0)root;'))
   >>> taxa = ['U1', 'U2', 'U3', 'U4', 'U5', 'U6', 'U7']
   >>> adiv_faith_pd = alpha_diversity('faith_pd', data, ids=ids,
   ...                                 taxa=taxa, tree=tree)
   >>> adiv_faith_pd
   A    6.75
   B    7.00
   C    6.25
   D    5.75
   E    6.75
   F    5.50
   dtype: float64

   Now we'll compute Bray-Curtis distances, a beta diversity metric, between
   all pairs of samples. Notice that the ``data`` and ``ids`` parameters
   provided to ``beta_diversity`` are the same as those provided to
   ``alpha_diversity``.

   >>> from skbio.diversity import beta_diversity
   >>> bc_dm = beta_diversity("braycurtis", data, ids)
   >>> print(bc_dm)
   6x6 distance matrix
   IDs:
   'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'
   Data:
   [[ 0.          0.78787879  0.86666667  0.30927835  0.85714286  0.81521739]
    [ 0.78787879  0.          0.78142077  0.86813187  0.75        0.1627907 ]
    [ 0.86666667  0.78142077  0.          0.87709497  0.09392265  0.71597633]
    [ 0.30927835  0.86813187  0.87709497  0.          0.87777778  0.89285714]
    [ 0.85714286  0.75        0.09392265  0.87777778  0.          0.68235294]
    [ 0.81521739  0.1627907   0.71597633  0.89285714  0.68235294  0.        ]]

   Next, we'll compute weighted UniFrac distances between all pairs of samples.
   Because weighted UniFrac is a phylogenetic beta diversity metric, we'll need
   to pass the ``skbio.TreeNode`` and list of taxa that we created above.
   Again, these are the same values that were provided to ``alpha_diversity``.

   >>> wu_dm = beta_diversity("weighted_unifrac", data, ids, tree=tree,
   ...                        taxa=taxa)
   >>> print(wu_dm)
   6x6 distance matrix
   IDs:
   'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'
   Data:
   [[ 0.          2.77549923  3.82857143  0.42512039  3.8547619   3.10937312]
    [ 2.77549923  0.          2.26433692  2.98435423  2.24270353  0.46774194]
    [ 3.82857143  2.26433692  0.          3.95224719  0.16025641  1.86111111]
    [ 0.42512039  2.98435423  3.95224719  0.          3.98796148  3.30870431]
    [ 3.8547619   2.24270353  0.16025641  3.98796148  0.          1.82967033]
    [ 3.10937312  0.46774194  1.86111111  3.30870431  1.82967033  0.        ]]

   Next we'll do some work with these beta diversity distance matrices. First,
   we'll determine if the UniFrac and Bray-Curtis distance matrices are
   significantly correlated by computing the Mantel correlation between them.
   Then we'll determine if the p-value is significant based on an alpha of
   0.05.

   >>> from skbio.stats.distance import mantel
   >>> r, p_value, n = mantel(wu_dm, bc_dm)
   >>> print(r)
   0.922404392093
   >>> alpha = 0.05
   >>> print(p_value < alpha)
   True

   Next, we'll perform principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) on our weighted
   UniFrac distance matrix.

   >>> from skbio.stats.ordination import pcoa
   >>> wu_pc = pcoa(wu_dm)

   PCoA plots are only really interesting in the context of sample metadata, so
   let's define some before we visualize these results.

   >>> import pandas as pd
   >>> sample_md = pd.DataFrame([
   ...    ['gut', 's1'],
   ...    ['skin', 's1'],
   ...    ['tongue', 's1'],
   ...    ['gut', 's2'],
   ...    ['tongue', 's2'],
   ...    ['skin', 's2']],
   ...    index=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'],
   ...    columns=['body_site', 'subject'])
   >>> sample_md
     body_site subject
   A       gut      s1
   B      skin      s1
   C    tongue      s1
   D       gut      s2
   E    tongue      s2
   F      skin      s2

   Now let's plot our PCoA results, coloring each sample by the subject it
   was taken from:

   >>> fig = wu_pc.plot(
   ...     sample_md, 'subject',
   ...     axis_labels=('PC 1', 'PC 2', 'PC 3'),
   ...     title='Samples colored by subject',
   ...     cmap='jet', s=50
   ... )  # doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::
   :context:

   We don't see any clustering/grouping of samples. If we were to instead color
   the samples by the body site they were taken from, we see that the samples
   from the same body site (those that are colored the same) appear to be
   closer to one another in the 3-D space then they are to samples from
   other body sites.

   >>> fig = wu_pc.plot(
   ...     sample_md, 'body_site',
   ...     axis_labels=('PC 1', 'PC 2', 'PC 3'),
   ...     title='Samples colored by body site',
   ...     cmap='jet', s=50
   ... )  # doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::
   :context:

   Ordination techniques, such as PCoA, are useful for exploratory analysis.
   The next step is to quantify the strength of the grouping/clustering that we
   see in ordination plots. There are many statistical methods available to
   accomplish this; many operate on distance matrices. Let's use ANOSIM to
   quantify the strength of the clustering we see in the ordination plots
   above, using our weighted UniFrac distance matrix and sample metadata.

   First test the grouping of samples by subject:

   >>> from skbio.stats.distance import anosim
   >>> results = anosim(wu_dm, sample_md, column='subject', permutations=999)
   >>> results['test statistic']
   -0.33333333333333331
   >>> results['p-value'] < 0.1
   False

   The negative value of ANOSIM's R statistic indicates anti-clustering and the
   p-value is insignificant at an alpha of 0.1.

   Now let's test the grouping of samples by body site:

   >>> results = anosim(wu_dm, sample_md, column='body_site', permutations=999)
   >>> results['test statistic']
   1.0
   >>> results['p-value'] < 0.1
   True

   The R statistic indicates strong separation of samples based on body site.
   The p-value is significant at an alpha of 0.1.

   We can also explore the alpha diversity in the context of sample metadata.
   To do this, let's add the observed richness and Faith's PD metrics to our
   sample metadata. This is straight-forward because ``alpha_diversity``
   returns a Pandas ``Series`` object, and we're representing our sample
   metadata in a Pandas ``DataFrame`` object.

   >>> sample_md['Obs. richness'] = adiv_sobs
   >>> sample_md['Faith PD'] = adiv_faith_pd
   >>> sample_md
     body_site subject  Obs. richness  Faith PD
   A       gut      s1              5      6.75
   B      skin      s1              5      7.00
   C    tongue      s1              4      6.25
   D       gut      s2              4      5.75
   E    tongue      s2              5      6.75
   F      skin      s2              3      5.50

   We can investigate these alpha diversity data in the context of our metadata
   categories. For example, we can generate boxplots showing Faith PD by body
   site.

   >>> fig = sample_md.boxplot(column='Faith PD', by='body_site')  # doctest: +SKIP

We can also compute Spearman correlations between all pairs of columns in
this ``DataFrame``. Since our alpha diversity metrics are the only two
numeric columns (and thus the only columns for which Spearman correlation
is relevant), this will give us a symmetric 2x2 correlation matrix.

>>> sample_md.corr(method="spearman", numeric_only=True)
               Obs. richness  Faith PD
Obs. richness       1.000000  0.939336
Faith PD            0.939336  1.000000
