    """Store biological sequence data and optional associated metadata.

    ``Sequence`` objects do not enforce an alphabet and are thus the most
    generic objects for storing biological sequence data. Subclasses ``DNA``,
    ``RNA``, and ``Protein`` enforce the IUPAC character set [1]_ for, and
    provide operations specific to, each respective molecule type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : str, Sequence, or 1D np.ndarray (np.uint8 or '\|S1')
        Characters representing the biological sequence itself.
    id : str, optional
        Sequence identifier (e.g., an accession number).
    description : str, optional
        Description or comment about the sequence (e.g., "green fluorescent
        protein").
    quality : 1D array_like (int), optional
        Phred quality scores stored as nonnegative integers, one per sequence
        character. If provided, must be the same length as the biological
        sequence. Can be a 1D ``np.ndarray`` of integers or a structure that
        can be converted into this representation using ``np.asarray``. A copy
        will *not* be made if `quality` is already a 1D ``np.ndarray``
        with an ``int`` ``dtype``. The array will be made read-only (i.e., its
        ``WRITEABLE`` flag will be set to ``False``).

        By default, the two sequences are *not* considered equal because their

        Parameters

            `included` is transformed into a flat boolean vector where each

            Whether to invert `included` such that it describes what should be
            skipped instead of included. Default is False.

        Returns
        -------

        Notes
        -----
        If slices provide adjacent ranges, then they will be considered the
        same contiguous subsequence.

        Examples
        --------
        Here we use `iter_contiguous` to find all of the contiguous ungapped
        sequences using a boolean vector derived from our DNA sequence.

        >>> from skbio import DNA
        >>> s = DNA('AAA--TT-CCCC-G-')
        >>> no_gaps = ~s.gaps()
        >>> for ungapped_subsequence in s.iter_contiguous(no_gaps,
        ...                                               min_length=2):
        ...     ungapped_subsequence
        DNA('AAA', length=3)
        DNA('TT', length=2)
        DNA('CCCC', length=4)

        Note how the last potential subsequence was skipped because it would
        have been smaller than our `min_length` which was set to 2.

        We can also use `iter_contiguous` on a generator of slices as is
        produced by `find_motifs` (and `find_with_regex`).

        >>> from skbio import Protein
        >>> s = Protein('ACDFNASANFTACGNPNRTESL')
        >>> for subseq in s.iter_contiguous(s.find_motifs('N-glycosylation')):
        ...     subseq
        Protein('NASANFTA', length=8)
        Protein('NRTE', length=4)

        Note how the first subsequence contains two N-glycosylation sites. This
        happened because they were contiguous.

        kwargs : dict, optional

        Notes
        -----
        This is a shallow copy, but since biological sequences are immutable,
        it is conceptually the same as a deep copy.

        This method is the preferred way of creating new instances from an
        existing biological sequence, instead of calling
        ``self.__class__(...)``, as the latter can be error-prone (e.g.,
        it's easy to forget to propagate attributes to the new instance).

        Create a copy of ``seq``, keeping the same underlying sequence of
        characters and quality scores, while updating ID and description:

        >>> new_seq = seq._to(id='new-id', description='new description')

        Note that the copied biological sequence's underlying sequence and
        quality scores are the same as ``seq``:

        >>> str(new_seq)
        'AACCGGTT'
        >>> new_seq.quality
        array([ 4,  2, 22, 23,  1,  1,  1,  9])
