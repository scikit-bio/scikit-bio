class BiologicalSequence(Sequence):
    """Base class for biological sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : python Sequence (e.g., str, list or tuple)
        The biological sequence.
    id : str, optional
        The sequence id (e.g., an accession number).
    description : str, optional
        A description or comment about the sequence (e.g., "green
        fluorescent protein").
    quality : 1-D array_like, int, optional
        Integer quality scores, one per sequence character. If provided, must
        be the same length as the biological sequence. Can be a 1-D
        ``numpy.ndarray`` of integers, or a structure that can be converted to
        this representation using ``numpy.asarray``. A copy will *not* be made
        if `quality` is already a 1-D ``numpy.ndarray`` with an ``int``
        ``dtype``. The array will be made read-only (i.e., its ``WRITEABLE``
        flag will be set to ``False``).
    validate : bool, optional
        If True, runs the `is_valid` method after construction and raises
        BiologicalSequenceError if ``is_valid == False``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sequence
    id
    description
    quality

    Raises
    ------
    skbio.sequence.BiologicalSequenceError
        If ``validate == True`` and ``is_valid == False``, or if `quality` is
        not the correct shape.

    Notes
    -----
    `BiologicalSequence` objects are immutable. Where applicable, methods
    return a new object of the same class.
    Subclasses are typically defined by methods relevant to only a specific
    type of biological sequence, and by containing characters only contained in
    the IUPAC standard character set [1]_ for that molecule type.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a shallow copy, but since biological sequences are immutable,
        it is conceptually the same as a deep copy.

        This method is the preferred way of creating new instances from an
        existing biological sequence, instead of calling
        ``self.__class__(...)``, as the latter can be error-prone (e.g.,
        forgetting to propagate attributes to the new instance).

        Examples
        --------
        Create a biological sequence:

        >>> from skbio import BiologicalSequence
        >>> seq = BiologicalSequence('AACCGGTT', id='id1',
        ...                          description='biological sequence',
        ...                          quality=[4, 2, 22, 23, 1, 1, 1, 9])

        Create a copy of ``seq``, keeping the same underlying sequence of
        characters and quality scores, while updating ID and description:

        >>> new_seq = seq.copy(id='new-id', description='new description')

        Note that the copied biological sequence's underlying sequence and
        quality scores are the same as ``seq``:

        >>> new_seq.sequence
        'AACCGGTT'
        >>> new_seq.quality
        array([ 4,  2, 22, 23,  1,  1,  1,  9])

        'new-id'
        >>> new_seq.description
        'new description'
