    """Compute correlation between distance matrices using the Mantel test.

    The Mantel test compares two distance matrices by computing the correlation
    between the distances in the lower (or upper) triangular portions of the
    symmetric distance matrices. Correlation can be computed using Pearson's
    product-moment correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation
    coefficient.

    As defined in [1]_, the Mantel test computes a test statistic :math:`r_M`
    given two symmetric distance matrices :math:`D_X` and :math:`D_Y`.
    :math:`r_M` is defined as

    .. math::

       r_M=\\frac{1}{d-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}
       stand(D_X)_{ij}stand(D_Y)_{ij}

    where

    .. math::

       d=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}

    and :math:`n` is the number of rows/columns in each of the distance
    matrices. :math:`stand(D_X)` and :math:`stand(D_Y)` are distance matrices
    with their upper triangles containing standardized distances. Note that
    since :math:`D_X` and :math:`D_Y` are symmetric, the lower triangular
    portions of the matrices could equivalently have been used instead of the
    upper triangular portions (the current function behaves in this manner).

    If ``method='spearman'``, the above equation operates on ranked distances
    instead of the original distances.

    Statistical significance is assessed via a permutation test. The rows and
    columns of the first distance matrix (`x`) are randomly permuted a
    number of times (controlled via `permutations`). A correlation coefficient
    is computed for each permutation and the p-value is the proportion of
    permuted correlation coefficients that are equal to or more extreme
    than the original (unpermuted) correlation coefficient. Whether a permuted
    correlation coefficient is "more extreme" than the original correlation
    coefficient depends on the alternative hypothesis (controlled via
    `alternative`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : DistanceMatrix or array_like
        Input distance matrices to compare. If `x` and `y` are both
        ``DistanceMatrix`` instances, they will be reordered based on matching
        IDs (see `strict` and `lookup` below for handling matching/mismatching
        IDs); thus they are not required to be in the same ID order. If `x` and
        `y` are ``array_like``, no reordering is applied and both matrices must
        have the same shape. In either case, `x` and `y` must be at least 3x3
        in size *after* reordering and matching of IDs.
    method : {'pearson', 'spearman'}
        Method used to compute the correlation between distance matrices.
    permutations : int, optional
        Number of times to randomly permute `x` when assessing statistical
        significance. Must be greater than or equal to zero. If zero,
        statistical significance calculations will be skipped and the p-value
        will be ``np.nan``.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'greater', 'less'}
        Alternative hypothesis to use when calculating statistical
        significance. The default ``'two-sided'`` alternative hypothesis
        calculates the proportion of permuted correlation coefficients whose
        magnitude (i.e. after taking the absolute value) is greater than or
        equal to the absolute value of the original correlation coefficient.
        ``'greater'`` calculates the proportion of permuted coefficients that
        are greater than or equal to the original coefficient. ``'less'``
        calculates the proportion of permuted coefficients that are less than
        or equal to the original coefficient.
    strict : bool, optional
        If ``True``, raises a ``ValueError`` if IDs are found that do not exist
        in both distance matrices. If ``False``, any nonmatching IDs are
        discarded before running the test. See `n` (in Returns section below)
        for the number of matching IDs that were used in the test. This
        parameter is ignored if `x` and `y` are ``array_like``.
    lookup : dict, optional
        Maps each ID in the distance matrices to a new ID. Used to match up IDs
        across distance matrices prior to running the Mantel test. If the IDs
        already match between the distance matrices, this parameter is not
        necessary. This parameter is disallowed if `x` and `y` are
        ``array_like``.

    Returns
    -------
    corr_coeff : float
        Correlation coefficient of the test (depends on `method`).
    p_value : float
        p-value of the test.
    n : int
        Number of rows/columns in each of the distance matrices, after any
        reordering/matching of IDs. If ``strict=False``, nonmatching IDs may
        have been discarded from one or both of the distance matrices prior to
        running the Mantel test, so this value may be important as it indicates
        the *actual* size of the matrices that were compared.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `x` and `y` are not at least 3x3 in size after reordering/matching
        of IDs, or an invalid `method`, number of `permutations`, or
        `alternative` are provided.
    TypeError
        If `x` and `y` are not both ``DistanceMatrix`` instances or
        ``array_like``.

    Notes
    -----
    The Mantel test was first described in [2]_. The general algorithm and
    interface are similar to ``vegan::mantel``, available in R's vegan
    package [3]_.

    ``np.nan`` will be returned for the p-value if `permutations` is zero or if
    the correlation coefficient is ``np.nan``. The correlation coefficient will
    be ``np.nan`` if one or both of the inputs does not have any variation
    (i.e. the distances are all constant) and ``method='spearman'``.

    Examples
    --------
    Import the functionality we'll use in the following examples:

    >>> from skbio import DistanceMatrix
    >>> from skbio.stats.distance import mantel

    Define two 3x3 distance matrices:

    >>> x = DistanceMatrix([[0, 1, 2],
    ...                     [1, 0, 3],
    ...                     [2, 3, 0]])
    >>> y = DistanceMatrix([[0, 2, 7],
    ...                     [2, 0, 6],
    ...                     [7, 6, 0]])

    Compute the Pearson correlation between them and assess significance using
    a two-sided test with 999 permutations:

    >>> coeff, p_value, n = mantel(x, y)
    >>> print(round(coeff, 4))
    0.7559

    Thus, we see a moderate-to-strong positive correlation (:math:`r_M=0.7559`)
    between the two matrices.

    In the previous example, the distance matrices (``x`` and ``y``) have the
    same IDs, in the same order:

    >>> x.ids
    ('0', '1', '2')
    >>> y.ids
    ('0', '1', '2')

    If necessary, ``mantel`` will reorder the distance matrices prior to
    running the test. The function also supports a ``lookup`` dictionary that
    maps distance matrix IDs to new IDs, providing a way to match IDs between
    distance matrices prior to running the Mantel test.

    For example, let's reassign the distance matrices' IDs so that there are no
    matching IDs between them:

    >>> x.ids = ('a', 'b', 'c')
    >>> y.ids = ('d', 'e', 'f')

    If we rerun ``mantel``, we get the following error notifying us that there
    are nonmatching IDs (this is the default behavior with ``strict=True``):

    >>> mantel(x, y)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: IDs exist that are not in both distance matrices.

    If we pass ``strict=False`` to ignore/discard nonmatching IDs, we see that
    no matches exist between `x` and `y`, so the Mantel test still cannot be
    run:

    >>> mantel(x, y, strict=False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: No matching IDs exist between the distance matrices.

    To work around this, we can define a ``lookup`` dictionary to specify how
    the IDs should be matched between distance matrices:

    >>> lookup = {'a': 'A', 'b': 'B', 'c': 'C',
    ...           'd': 'A', 'e': 'B', 'f': 'C'}

    ``lookup`` maps each ID to ``'A'``, ``'B'``, or ``'C'``. If we rerun
    ``mantel`` with ``lookup``, we get the same results as the original
    example where all distance matrix IDs matched:

    >>> coeff, p_value, n = mantel(x, y, lookup=lookup)
    >>> print(round(coeff, 4))
    0.7559

    ``mantel`` also accepts input that is ``array_like``. For example, if we
    redefine `x` and `y` as nested Python lists instead of ``DistanceMatrix``
    instances, we obtain the same result:

    >>> x = [[0, 1, 2],
    ...      [1, 0, 3],
    ...      [2, 3, 0]]
    >>> y = [[0, 2, 7],
    ...      [2, 0, 6],
    ...      [7, 6, 0]]
    >>> coeff, p_value, n = mantel(x, y)
    >>> print(round(coeff, 4))
    0.7559

    It is import to note that reordering/matching of IDs (and hence the
    ``strict`` and ``lookup`` parameters) do not apply when input is
    ``array_like`` because there is no notion of IDs.

    Runs a Mantel test for each pair of distance matrices and collates the

    pandas.DataFrame
        ``DataFrame`` containing the results of each pairwise test (one per

    Notes
    --------
    Passing a list of filepaths can be useful as it allows for a smaller amount
    of memory consumption as it only loads two matrices at a time as opposed to
    loading all distance matrices into memory.

    --------

    Run Mantel tests for each pair of distance matrices (there are 3 possible
    pairs):
