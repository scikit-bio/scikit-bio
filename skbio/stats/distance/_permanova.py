def permanova(distance_matrix, grouping, column=None, permutations=999):
    """Test for significant differences between groups using PERMANOVA.

    Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) is a
    non-parametric method that tests whether two or more groups of objects
    (e.g., samples) are significantly different based on a categorical factor.
    It is conceptually similar to ANOVA except that it operates on a distance
    matrix, which allows for multivariate analysis. PERMANOVA computes a
    pseudo-F statistic.

    Statistical significance is assessed via a permutation test. The assignment
    of objects to groups (`grouping`) is randomly permuted a number of times
    (controlled via `permutations`). A pseudo-F statistic is computed for each
    permutation and the p-value is the proportion of permuted pseudo-F
    statisics that are equal to or greater than the original (unpermuted)
    pseudo-F statistic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
        Distance matrix containing distances between objects (e.g., distances
        between samples of microbial communities).
    grouping : 1-D array_like or pandas.DataFrame
        Vector indicating the assignment of objects to groups. For example,
        these could be strings or integers denoting which group an object
        belongs to. If `grouping` is 1-D ``array_like``, it must be the same
        length and in the same order as the objects in `distance_matrix`. If
        `grouping` is a ``DataFrame``, the column specified by `column` will be
        used as the grouping vector. The ``DataFrame`` must be indexed by the
        IDs in `distance_matrix` (i.e., the row labels must be distance matrix
        IDs), but the order of IDs between `distance_matrix` and the
        ``DataFrame`` need not be the same. All IDs in the distance matrix must
        be present in the ``DataFrame``. Extra IDs in the ``DataFrame`` are
        allowed (they are ignored in the calculations).
    column : str, optional
        Column name to use as the grouping vector if `grouping` is a
        ``DataFrame``. Must be provided if `grouping` is a ``DataFrame``.
        Cannot be provided if `grouping` is 1-D ``array_like``.
    permutations : int, optional
        Number of permutations to use when assessing statistical
        significance. Must be greater than or equal to zero. If zero,
        statistical significance calculations will be skipped and the p-value
        will be ``np.nan``.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Results of the statistical test, including ``test statistic`` and
        ``p-value``.

    --------
    anosim

    Notes
    -----
    See [1]_ for the original method reference, as well as ``vegan::adonis``,
    available in R's vegan package [2]_.

    The p-value will be ``np.nan`` if `permutations` is zero.
