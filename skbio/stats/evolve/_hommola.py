def hommola_cospeciation(host_dist, par_dist, interaction, permutations=999):
    """Perform Hommola et al (2009) host/parasite cospeciation test.

    This test for host/parasite cospeciation is as described in [1]_. This test
    is a modification of a Mantel test, expanded to accept the case where
    multiple hosts map to a single parasite (and vice versa).

    For a basic Mantel test, the distance matrices being compared must have the
    same number of values. To determine the significance of the correlations
    between distances in the two matrices, the correlation coefficient of those
    distances is calculated and compared to the correlation coefficients
    calculated from a set of matrices in which rows and columns have been
    permuted.

    In this test, rather than comparing host-host to parasite-parasite
    distances directly (requiring one host per parasite), the distances are
    compared for each interaction edge between host and parasite. Thus, a host
    interacting with two different parasites will be represented in two
    different edges, with the host-host distance for the comparison between
    those edges equal to zero, and the parasite-parasite distance equal to the
    distance between those two parasites. Like in the Mantel test, significance
    of the interaction is assessed by permutation, in this case permutation of
    the host-symbiont interaction links.

    Note that the null hypothesis being tested here is that the hosts and
    parasites have evolved independently of one another. The alternative to
    this is a somewhat weaker case than what is often implied with the term
    'cospeciation,' which is that each incidence of host speciation is
    recapitulated in an incidence of symbiont speciation (strict
    co-cladogenesis). Although there may be many factors that could contribute
    to non-independence of host and symbiont phylogenies, this loss of
    explanatory specificity comes with increased robustness to phylogenetic
    uncertainty. Thus, this test may be especially useful for cases where host
    and/or symbiont phylogenies are poorly resolved, or when simple correlation
    between host and symbiont evolution is of more interest than strict
    co-cladogenesis.

    This test requires pairwise distance matrices for hosts and symbionts, as
    well as an interaction matrix specifying links between hosts (in columns)
    and symbionts (in rows). This interaction matrix should have the same
    number of columns as the host distance matrix, and the same number of rows
    as the symbiont distance matrix. Interactions between hosts and symbionts
    should be indicated by values of ``1`` or ``True``, with non-interactions
    indicated by values of ``0`` or ``False``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host_dist : 2-D array_like or DistanceMatrix
        Symmetric matrix of m x m pairwise distances between hosts.
    par_dist : 2-D array_like or DistanceMatrix
        Symmetric matrix of n x n pairwise distances between parasites.
    interaction : 2-D array_like, bool
        n x m binary matrix of parasite x host interactions. Order of hosts
        (columns) should be identical to order of hosts in `host_dist`, as
        should order of parasites (rows) be identical to order of parasites in
        `par_dist`.
    permutations : int, optional
        Number of permutations used to compute p-value. Must be greater than or
        equal to zero. If zero, statistical significance calculations will be
        skipped and the p-value will be ``np.nan``.

    Returns
    -------
    corr_coeff : float
        Pearson correlation coefficient of host : parasite association.
    p_value : float
        Significance of host : parasite association computed using
        `permutations` and a one-sided (greater) alternative hypothesis.
    perm_stats : 1-D numpy.ndarray, float
        Correlation coefficients observed using permuted host : parasite
        interactions. Length will be equal to the number of permutations used
        to compute p-value (see `permutations` parameter above).

    scipy.stats.pearsonr

    Notes
    -----
    It is assumed that the ordering of parasites in `par_dist` and hosts in
    `host_dist` are identical to their ordering in the rows and columns,
    respectively, of the interaction matrix.

    This code is loosely based on the original R code from [1]_.

       Host-Parasite Cospeciation. Molecular Biology and Evolution, 26,
       1457-1468.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skbio.stats.evolve import hommola_cospeciation

    Create arrays for host distances, parasite distances, and their
    interactions (data taken from example in [1]_):

    >>> hdist = [[0,3,8,8,9], [3,0,7,7,8], [8,7,0,6,7], [8,7,6,0,3],
    ...          [9,8,7,3,0]]
    >>> pdist = [[0,5,8,8,8], [5,0,7,7,7], [8,7,0,4,4], [8,7,4,0,2],
    ...          [8,7,4,2,0]]
    >>> interaction = [[1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1,0],
    ...                [0,0,0,1,1]]

    Run the cospeciation test with 99 permutations. Note that the correlation
    coefficient for the observed values counts against the final reported
    p-value:

    >>> corr_coeff, p_value, perm_stats = hommola_cospeciation(
    ...     hdist, pdist, interaction, permutations=99)
    >>> print("%.3f" % corr_coeff)
    0.832

    In this case, the host distances have a fairly strong positive correlation
    with the symbiont distances. However, this may also reflect structure
    inherent in the phylogeny, and is not itself indicative of significance.

    >>> p_value <= 0.05
    True

    After permuting host : parasite interactions, we find that the observed
    correlation is indeed greater than we would expect by chance.
