    """Compute the weighted average and standard deviation along the

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Calculate average and standard deviation of these values.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the statistics are computed. The default is
        to compute them on the flattened array.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each
        value in `a` contributes to the average according to its
        associated weight. The weights array can either be 1-D (in
        which case its length must be the size of `a` along the given
        axis) or of the same shape as `a`. If `weights=None`, then all
        data in `a` are assumed to have a weight equal to one.
    with_mean : bool, optional, defaults to True
        Compute average if True.
    with_std : bool, optional, defaults to True
        Compute standard deviation if True.
    ddof : int, optional, defaults to 0
        It means delta degrees of freedom. Variance is calculated by
        dividing by `n - ddof` (where `n` is the number of
        elements). By default it computes the maximum likelyhood
        estimator.
