# cd into a directory that is different from scikit-bio root directory to
# simulate a user's install and testing of scikit-bio. Running from the root
# directory will find the `skbio` subpackage (not necessarily the installed
# one!) because cwd is considered in Python's search path. It is important to
# simulate a user's install/test process this way to find package data that did
# not install correctly (for example).
