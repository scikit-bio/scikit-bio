# QA Analysis of scikit-bio: Project Proposal

## Project Overview

I analyzed the quality of scikit-bio, a Python library used for biology research. This library has lots of code for handling biological data, so it was a good example to study for a QA class.

My goal was to measure how maintainable and testable the code is using simple metrics. This helped me understand if the code is well-written and easy to work with.

### What I Did
- Counted lines of code and comments in all the files
- Found how many tests exist and what they cover
- Analyzed if the code is too complex or hard to maintain
- Wrote this report about what I found

### How I Did It
I analyzed the scikit-bio code that has about 117,000 lines of Python code. I used Python scripts to automatically count things and collect the data I needed.

## Quality Metrics I Measured

### 1. Maintainability 

**Lines of Code per File**
- How big each file is
- Found: Files go from 7 lines to 6,079 lines 
- Total: 117,190 lines of code
- Big files might be hard to work with

**Comment Density**
- How much of the code has comments explaining what it does
- Found: Average of 15.9% comments
- Some files have 0% comments, others have 100%
- Good code usually has 20-30% comments

**Code Complexity (maybe)**
- How complicated the code is
- Complex code is harder to fix and understand

### 2. Testability

**Number of Tests**
- Found: 104 test files with 2,545 test functions
- Shows the project cares about testing
- More tests usually means better quality

**Test Coverage**
- What percentage of code is actually tested
- Need to check if important parts are missing tests

## Tools I Used

- Python scripts to count lines and comments
- Python AST module to find functions and tests
- Custom metrics collection script that analyzes the entire codebase

This analysis helped me understand how to measure code quality on a real project with actual data.
