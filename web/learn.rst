Books
-----

`An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics <https://readiab.org/>`_, or **IAB**: An interactive bioinformatics textbook developed by By `Dr. Greg Caporaso <https://cap-lab.bio/>`_ and colleagues at NAU.

Available in Jupyter Book, Markdown, and PDF formats, IAB guides readers through the core concepts of bioinformatics with their practical application using Python libraries like scikit-learn and scikit-bio. This approach equips readers with the skills to develop their bioinformatics tools and pipelines, emphasizing rapid project initiation over theoretical depth. Focused on actionable knowledge, IAB prepares readers for effective roles in the bioinformatics field.
