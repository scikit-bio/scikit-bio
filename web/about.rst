About scikit-bio
================

scikit-bio (canonically pronounced *sigh-kit-buy-oh*) is a library for working with biological data in Python. scikit-bio is open source BSD-licensed software that is currently under active development.


Adoption
--------

Some of the projects that we know of that are using scikit-bio are:

- `QIIME 2 <https://qiime2.org/>`_, `Qiita <https://qiita.ucsd.edu/>`_, `Emperor <https://biocore.github.io/emperor/>`_, `tax2tree <https://github.com/biocore/tax2tree>`_, `ghost-tree <https://github.com/JTFouquier/ghost-tree>`_, `Platypus-Conquistador <https://github.com/biocore/Platypus-Conquistador>`_, `An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics <https://readiab.org>`_.


License
-------

scikit-bio is available under the new BSD license. See :repo:`LICENSE.txt <blob/main/LICENSE.txt>` for scikit-bio's license, and the :repo:`licenses directory <tree/main/licenses>` for the licenses of third-party software that is (either partially or entirely) distributed with scikit-bio.


Team
----

Our core development team consists of three lead developers: **Dr. Qiyun Zhu** at Arizona State University (ASU) (@qiyunzhu), **Dr. James Morton** at Gutz Analytics (@mortonjt), and **Dr. Daniel McDonald** at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) (@wasade), and one dedicated software engineer: **Matthew Aton** at ASU (@mataton). **Dr. Rob Knight** at UCSD (@rob-knight) provides guidance on the development and research. **Dr. Greg Caporaso** (@gregcaporaso) at Northern Arizona University (NAU), the former leader of the scikit-bio project, serves as an advisor on the current project.


Credits
-------

We thank the many contributors to scikit-bio. A complete :repo:`list of contributors <graphs/contributors>` to the scikit-bio codebase is available at GitHub. This however may miss the larger community who contributed by testing the software and providing valuable comments, who we hold equal appreciation to.
