scikit-bio is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python package providing data structures, algorithms and educational resources for bioinformatics.

To view scikit-bio's documentation, visit `scikit-bio.org
<http://scikit-bio.org>`__.

scikit-bio is currently in alpha. We are very actively developing it, and **backwards-incompatible interface changes can and will arise**. Once the API has started to solidify, we will strive to maintain backwards compatibility. We will provide deprecation warnings wherever possible in the scikit-bio code, documentation, and `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

**Note:** Deprecation warnings will be issued using Python's ``DeprecationWarning`` class. Since Python 2.7, these types of warnings are **silenced by default**. When developing a tool that uses scikit-bio, we recommend enabling the display of deprecation warnings to be informed of upcoming API changes. For details on how to display deprecation warnings, see `Python's deprecation warning docs <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#changes-to-the-handling-of-deprecation-warnings>`_.

Installing
----------

To install the latest release of scikit-bio::

    pip install scikit-bio

Equivalently, you can use the ``conda`` package manager available in `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ to install scikit-bio and its dependencies without having to compile them::

    conda install scikit-bio

Finally, most of scikit-bio's dependencies (in particular, the ones that are trickier to build) are also available, albeit only for Python 2, in `Canopy Express <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_.

You can verify your installation by running the scikit-bio unit tests::

    python -m skbio.test
