scikit-bio is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python package providing data structures, algorithms and educational resources for bioinformatics.

To view scikit-bio's documentation, visit `scikit-bio.org
<http://scikit-bio.org>`__.

scikit-bio is currently in beta. We are very actively developing it, and **backward-incompatible interface changes can and will arise**. To avoid these types of changes being a surprise to our users, our public APIs are decorated to make it clear to users when an API can be relied upon (stable) and when it may be subject to change (experimental). See the `API stability docs <https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/blob/master/doc/source/user/api_stability.rst>`_ for more details, including what we mean by *stable* and *experimental* in this context.

Installing
----------
Equivalently, you can use the ``conda`` package manager available in `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ to install scikit-bio and its dependencies without having to compile them::

    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/biocore scikit-bio


Equivalently, To install the latest release of scikit-bio::

    pip install scikit-bio

When installing scikit-bio using pip/setup.py, make sure to install NumPy first before proceeding to install scikit-bio.The install instruction for installing NumPy is::
   
   pip install numpy

Equivalently, you can use the ``conda`` package manager available in `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ to install scikit-bio and its dependencies without having to compile them::

    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/biocore scikit-bio

Finally, most of scikit-bio's dependencies (in particular, the ones that are trickier to build) are also available, albeit only for Python 2, in `Canopy Express <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_.

You can verify your installation by running the scikit-bio unit tests::

    python -m skbio.test
