scikit-bio is an open-source, BSD-licensed python package providing data structures, algorithms and educational resources for bioinformatics.

To view scikit-bio's documentation, visit `scikit-bio.org
<http://scikit-bio.org>`__.

scikit-bio is currently in alpha. We are very actively developing it, and **backwards-incompatible interface changes can and will arise**. Once the API has started to solidify, we will strive to maintain backwards compatibility. We will provide deprecation warnings wherever possible in the scikit-bio code, documentation, and CHANGELOG.md.

**Note:** Deprecation warnings will be issued using Python's ``DeprecationWarning`` class. Since Python 2.7, these types of warnings are **silenced by default**. When developing a tool that uses scikit-bio, we recommend enabling the display of deprecation warnings to be informed of upcoming API changes. For details on how to display deprecation warnings, see `Python's deprecation warning docs <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#changes-to-the-handling-of-deprecation-warnings>`_.

Installation of release version (recommended for most users)
------------------------------------------------------------

To install the latest release version of scikit-bio you should run::

    pip install scikit-bio

Equivalently, you can use the ``conda`` package manager available in `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ to install scikit-bio and all its dependencies, without having to compile them::

     conda install scikit-bio

Finally, most scikit-bio's dependencies (in particular, the ones that are trickier to build) are also available, albeit only for Python 2, in `Canopy Express <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_.

You can verify your installation by running the scikit-bio unit tests as follows::

    python -m skbio.test

In addition to the dependencies required by scikit-bio you may want to install
the following optional packages:

    * matplotlib (>= 1.1.0)

If a resource is used which requires one of these packages an ``ImportError``
will be raised.

Installation of development version
-----------------------------------

If you're interested in working with the latest development release of scikit-bio (recommended for developers only, as the development code can be unstable and less documented than the release code), you can clone the repository and install as follows. This will require that you have ``git`` installed.
::

    git clone git@github.com:biocore/scikit-bio.git
    cd scikit-bio
    pip install .

After this completes, you can run the scikit-bio unit tests from with a Python or IPython session as follows::

    import skbio
    skbio.test()

To only run tests for a specific scikit-bio module, for example skbio.sequence, you can do::

    skbio.sequence.test()

For developers of scikit-bio, if you don't want to be forced to re-install after every change, you can modify the above ``pip install`` command to::

    pip install -e .

This will build scikit-bio's Cython extensions, and will create a link in the ``site-packages`` directory to the scikit-bio source directory. When you then make changes to code in the source directory, those will be used (e.g., by the unit tests) without re-installing.

Finally, if you don't want to use ``pip`` to install scikit-bio, and prefer to just put ``scikit-bio`` in your ``$PYTHONPATH``, at the minimum you should run::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will build scikit-bio's Cython extensions, but not create a link to the scikit-bio source directory in ``site-packages``. If this isn't done, using certain components of scikit-bio will be inefficient and will produce an ``EfficiencyWarning``.
