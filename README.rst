*scikit-bio is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python 3 package providing data structures, algorithms and educational resources for bioinformatics.*


ðŸŒŸ Announcing the revitalization of scikit-bio! ðŸŒŸ
--------------------------------------------------

We are excited to announce the resurgence of **scikit-bio** (`<https://scikit.bio>`_)! With a re-assembled developer team and funding from the DOE, we're back with renewed vigor in 2024!

Our vision is to expand scikit-bio into a more robust and versatile library, catering to the ever-growing demands of multi-omic data analysis. This resurgence marks a new chapter in which we will focus on:

- Streamlining the analysis of diverse, massive omic data, emphasizing efficiency and versatility.
- Integrating advanced techniques for multi-omic integration to unravel the complex interplay between biological systems and environments.
- Implementing methods for modeling and annotating biological features utilizing community ecology and phylogenetics.

We invite the scientific community to join us in shaping the future of scikit-bio. Your expertise, feedback, and contributions will be the driving force behind this exciting phase.

Stay `tuned for updates <https://github.com/scikit-bio/scikit-bio/discussions/categories/announcements>`_, and let's innovate together for a deeper understanding of bio-complexities!
