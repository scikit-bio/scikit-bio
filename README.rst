scikit-bio is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python 3 package providing data structures, algorithms and educational resources for bioinformatics.

To view scikit-bio's documentation, visit `scikit-bio.org
<http://scikit-bio.org>`__.

**Note:** scikit-bio is no longer compatible with Python 2. scikit-bio is compatible with Python 3.4 and later.

scikit-bio is currently in beta. We are very actively developing it, and **backward-incompatible interface changes can and will arise**. To avoid these types of changes being a surprise to our users, our public APIs are decorated to make it clear to users when an API can be relied upon (stable) and when it may be subject to change (experimental). See the `API stability docs <https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio/blob/master/doc/source/user/api_stability.rst>`_ for more details, including what we mean by *stable* and *experimental* in this context.

Installing
----------

The recommended way to install scikit-bio is via the ``conda`` package manager available in `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.

To install the latest release of scikit-bio::

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-bio

Alternatively, you can install scikit-bio using ``pip``::

    pip install numpy

You can verify your installation by running the scikit-bio unit tests::

    python -m skbio.test

For users of Debian, ``skbio`` is in the Debian software distribution and may
be installed using::

    sudo apt-get install python3-skbio python-skbio-doc
