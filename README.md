**Note:** scikit-bio is currently under active development and its API is not
stable. Major compatibility-breaking API changes will likely happen as
development progresses. Once the API has started to solidify and we have an
official release, we will strive to maintain backwards compatibility, provide
deprecation warnings, etc. wherever possible. In the meantime, feel free to try
out scikit-bio and let us know what you think!
