Python.

**Note:** bipy is currently under active development and its API is not stable.
Major compatibility-breaking API changes will likely happen as development
progresses. Once the API has started to solidify and we have an official
release, we will strive to maintain backwards compatibility, provide
deprecation warnings, etc. wherever possible. In the meantime, feel free to try
out bipy and let us know what you think!
