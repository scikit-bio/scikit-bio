# scikit-bio changelog

## Version 0.1.2-dev (changes since 0.1.2 release go here)

## Version 0.1.2 (2014-06-12)

This is a pre-alpha release. At this stage, major backwards-incompatible API changes can and will happen.

### Features

* Added ``enforce_qual_range`` parameter to ``parse_fastq`` (on by default, maintaining backward compatibility). This allows disabling of the quality score range-checking.
* Added ``skbio.core.tree.nj``, which applies neighbor-joining for phylogenetic reconstruction.
* Added ``bioenv``, ``mantel``, and ``pwmantel`` distance-based statistics to ``skbio.math.stats.distance`` subpackage.
* Added ``skbio.math.stats.misc`` module for miscellaneous stats utility functions.
* IDs are now optional when constructing a ``DissimilarityMatrix`` or ``DistanceMatrix`` (monotonically-increasing integers cast as strings are automatically used).
* Added ``DistanceMatrix.permute`` method for randomly permuting rows and columns of a distance matrix.
* Added the following methods to ``DissimilarityMatrix``: ``filter``, ``index``, and ``__contains__`` for ID-based filtering, index lookup, and membership testing, respectively.
* Added ``ignore_comment`` parameter to ``parse_fasta`` (off by default, maintaining backward compatibility). This handles stripping the comment field from the header line (i.e., all characters beginning with the first space) before returning the label.
* Added imports of ``BiologicalSequence``, ``NucleotideSequence``, ``DNA``, ``DNASequence``, ``RNA``, ``RNASequence``, ``Protein``, ``ProteinSequence``, ``DistanceMatrix``, ``align_striped_smith_waterman``, `` SequenceCollection``, ``Alignment``, ``TreeNode``, ``nj``, ``parse_fasta``, ``parse_fastq``, ``parse_qual``, ``FastaIterator``, ``FastqIterator``, ``SequenceIterator`` in ``skbio/__init__.py`` for convenient importing. For example, it's now possible to ``from skbio import Alignment``, rather than ``from skbio.core.alignment import Alignment``.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a couple of unit tests that could fail stochastically.
* Added missing ``__init__.py`` files to a couple of test directories so that these tests won't be skipped.
* ``parse_fastq`` now raises an error on dangling records.
* Fixed several warnings that were raised while running the test suite with Python 3.4.

### Backward-incompatible changes

* Functionality imported from ``skbio.core.ssw`` must now be imported from ``skbio.core.alignment`` instead.

### Miscellaneous

* Code is now flake8-compliant; added flake8 checking to Travis build.
* Various additions and improvements to documentation (API, installation instructions, developer instructions, etc.).
* ``__future__`` imports are now standardized across the codebase.
* New website front page and styling changes throughout. Moved docs site to its own versioned subdirectories.
* Reorganized alignment data structures and algorithms (e.g., SSW code, ``Alignment`` class, etc.) into an ``skbio.core.alignment`` subpackage.
