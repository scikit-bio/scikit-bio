"""Provides some classes for treating files as sequences of records.

Typically more useful as subclasses. Covers the three main types of records:

    DelimitedRecordFinder:  Records demarcated by an end line, e.g. '\\'
    LabeledRecordFinder:    Records demarcated by a start line, e.g. '>label'
    LineGrouper:            Records consisting of a certain number of lines.
    TailedRecordFinder:     Records demarcated by an end mark, e.g. 'blah.'

All the first classes ignore/delete blank lines and strip leading and trailing
whitespace.  The TailedRecodeFinder is Functional similar to
DelimitedRecordFinder except that it accept a is_tail function instead of a
str.  Note that its default constuctor is rstrip instead of strip.
